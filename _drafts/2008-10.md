Waiting in the ER
Tue, 10/14/2008 - 7:10am — James A. Gayhart
I need a break. A few Fridays ago, Rachel started feeling sick. A few days later, I was also sick. I was out of work from Monday through Wednesday of last week. As I spent the majority of my time either sleeping or only marginally coherent, I did not accomplish a lot. Both my work and schoolwork suffered.

I was starting to get back to normal when my mother-in-law called Friday night. She was suffering from bad indigestion and was having a panic attack. Her indigestion medication only made problems worse. We ended up calling the rescue squad and going to the hospital.

Happy Halloween 2008

I know that today is Halloween, but it does not feel like it. It is probably because Rachel and I did not buy any candy this year to hand out (or for us). With me being unemployed, that tends to put a damper on any festivities. I did see a few trick-or-treaters a few hours ago at six. That was all that came by. So, maybe it is a good thing we did not spend money on candy. Anyway, I hope your holiday was better than ours was.

It is bad enough being out of work. Being sick is only worse. Over the weekend, I had major breathing problems. It felt like my chest was in a vice. Fortunately, I am feeling much better. At least I did not have to take off any sick days.

Last Day At GED Integrated Solutions

I go in to work today like normal. But, it was taking an awful long time to log into the network. I got down on my hands and knees to trace my cable back to the switch. Everything was connected as it should be and I was getting activity lights, but my network connection was still down.
