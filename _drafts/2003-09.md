OUT SICK
2003-09-26 02:53:50 PM EST 
Ugh. I've been sneezing all day. I think I've got a cold. Hopefully it goes away for the weekend. I don't want to be stuck in bed all weekend (even if I do need the sleep).

FASTRAK IS AT IT AGAIN
2003-09-25 02:26:44 PM EST 
Awhile ago, I got my fourth FasTrak violation. The violations, of course, were not my fault. Apparently FasTrak didn't like my explanation for the fourth violation (or more likely, they never received my letter). Anyway, the $2.00 toll would now cost me $27.00 (if it was my fault). So, $2.00 for the toll, $5.00 for a toll evasion fee and $20.00 for a late fee. I don't know about you, but having a late fee that is nearly three times the cost as the rest of the bill is just ridiculous. Fortunately, I don't have to pay this. But, I almost feel sorry for the real perpetrator. :)

VIRUS ALERTS
2003-09-22 11:13:29 AM EST 
I get the occasional spam and virus-infected attachment in my e-mail box everyday. Normally, that's not a big problem as I have software that filters out that junk automatically. This morning, however, I got several hundred copies of the same e-mail. It looks like an e-mail from Microsoft telling you to update your system. Included with the e-mail is the W32.Swen.A@mm virus. To make matters worse, each of the e-mails is about 100k. Needless to say, this significantly slows down my mail checking.

I urge everyone to make sure their operating system has the latest patches. Also, you should be running a firewall and anti-virus software. Additionally, it would be nice if you run an intrusion detection system.

NATIONAL DOG WEEK
2003-09-22 08:51:52 AM EST 
Since this week is National Dog Week, I've decided to post a picture of my puppy dog. Her name is "Emily Jean". though we usually call her "Emmy". As I've mentioned before, she's a Beagle/Spring mix. She will be three years old on September 24th, 2003.

We got Emmy at the end of last year, shortly after my other dog, Sir Chip-A-Lot (Chipper), died. It is interesting that Chipper was a English Springer Spaniel and my wife's former dog, Gopher, was a Beagle. I'm glad that we got the best of both worlds with Emmy.

===================
THE HURRICANE
2003-09-19 08:30:40 AM EST 
Well, we've been getting a lot of rain due to Tropical Storm Isabel. The funny thing is that we're getting more rain now then when a flood watch was declared in my area. I love the rain. Fortunately for us, the only damage that we've had is to our Strawberry Popcorn plants. Ah well. I guess we'll have to try to grow them again next year.

===================
OFFICE UPDATES
2003-09-17 02:10:09 PM EST 
After getting all of my Windows computers updated with the latest Windows service packs, I decided to update my copy of Office. I went to the Office Update site to download the latest patches. After spending a bit of time downloading the update, it asked me for disk 2 for Office. Unfortunately, I can only find disk 1 at the moment. Ugh

In other news, I've been configuring Samba on my Linux machine. I'm just having some networking fun. Next, I'm going to install a copy of Pervasive for Linux. I've got an application that already runs on Pervasive for Windows. I was curious to see how well it would run on Linux.

===================
RESUME
2003-09-16 02:27:33 PM EST 
I added my resume to my site. It isn't much, but at least it's a start.

===================
ROUGH MORNING
2003-09-15 09:05:53 AM EST 
Ugh. I've got a single-cup coffee maker. I put it on a timer so it makes my coffee about a half hour before I get up. Usually, it works great. I had some problems with my system yesterday. Apparently, I had forgotten to put the coffee grounds in the night before. Unfortunately, I didn't realize it until after I put the cream and sugar in and gave it a taste. It wasn't the first thing I wanted to taste in the morning (or at any time for that matter).

===================
LAST EXAM
2003-09-14 04:40:46 PM EST 
I just finished my last exam for my MIS class. Now, I only need to do my lab project(s) and my final exams and I'll be done with my degree! It's about time.

===================
BLACK RIVER RESERVATION, DAY'S DAM
2003-09-13 08:13:48 PM EST 
Today, my wife, dog and I went to Day's Dam in the Black River Reservation. It is one of the local parks. We walked for about two miles. We wanted to walk longer, bug the park closes as dusk, so we had to leave. Anyway, if you're in the area, you should stop by. The scenery is very pleasant.
===================

SIX EXAMS DOWN, TWO TO GO
2003-09-13 03:23:34 PM EST 
I just finished my sixth exam in my MIS class. At this rate, I'll be done by the end of the month!

===================
GOOGLE TOOLBAR
2003-09-12 03:17:59 PM EST 
I downloaded the Google Toolbar a few days agod. So far, it's very nice. I love the pop-up blocker. :)

THE SQUIRRELS ARE DRIVING MY DOG NUTS
2003-09-12 02:58:27 PM EST 
I've got a cute dog (Beagle/Springer mix) that just loves to chase the squirrels in my back yard. She'll walk out very slowly. Sometimes she almost crawls on her belly. She only moves when the squirrels aren't watching her. Then, when she's close enough, she pounces! She hasn't caught a squirrel yet. But, it's still very fun and interesting to watch.
===================

SEARCH BUG
2003-09-12 10:55:22 AM EST 
There was a bug in the my blog search tool. Sometimes the results would be duplicated. This has been fixed.

===================
HALFWAY POINT
2003-09-11 07:39:27 PM EST 
After finishing the fourth exam in my MIS class, I'm now at the half-way point!
===================

SCHOOL UPDATE
2003-09-11 02:09:57 PM EST 
I just finished my third MIS book, Computing Resources For MIS, and the exam. I only have five more book(lets) and exams before I'm done with this class. Whoo hoo!
===================

BLOGGER.COM CHANGES
2003-09-11 11:08:52 AM EST 
Blogger.com recently announced some new features for free accounts (like mine). The biggest feature (or at least the one I'll probably use the most) is the ability to spell check each post. Very cool.

===================
SEARCH FOR A GAME
2003-09-09 07:37:29 PM EST 
I've been looking for a Commodore 64 video game. But, I don't remember what it was called. It's been over ten years since I've played it. The plot was to go into a pyramid (tomb?) and navigate from room to room. The game was a 2D adventure game. I really enjoyed playing it when I could. Unfortunately, the game was on a tape cartridge. It would take over a half hour for the game to load. Sometimes it would take several attempts before it actually ran. It's driving me crazy now that I can't remember the name.
===================

FASTRAK VIOLATIONS AREN'T MY FAULT
2003-09-09 12:48:27 PM EST 
FasTrak, for those that don't know, is California's Electronic Toll System. Basically, you can pay in advance for tolls, and your vehicle will be tracked automatically at the toll plazas. It's nice for people who cross through toll booths often. It's generally cheaper and you don't have to stop to pay. FasTrak users get their own lanes. If a non-FasTrak user drives through a FasTrak-only lane, the system takes a picture of your rear license plate (front license plates aren't required in California) and mails you a violation notice.

I've gotten four FasTrak violations in the last few months. The funny thing is that it wasn't me. The vechicle pictured is a light-colored Ford, while my vehicle is a dark-colored Dodge. Also, the license plate in the picture wasn't mine (it was off by a few digits). Lastly, when the violation occurred (May 22, 2003), I was already in Ohio.

I was kind of amused when I got the first notice (on June 9th). I wrote them a letter explaining why I shouldn't be liable for the violation. After I got a second violation a week later and two more violations in August, it started to get annoying. In all four cases, it was the same vehicle. I also sent a letter back for each violation. Well finally, I got a response back from my first "violation". It only took three months! The good news is that I was found to be not at fault.
===================

MORNING AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE
2003-09-09 12:14:29 PM EST 
Well, so far it has been a long morning. I went with my wife to see the doctor (she's a Type 2 Diabetic). Anyway, it's the first time we've been to a doctor's office since the move from California. It was about a fifty minute drive in both directions. I had expected more traffic, but thankfully there wasn't much traffic. Of course, this meant that we arrived an hour early. This gave me a chance to work on some schoolwork.

I finished the remaining chapter (Information System Categories) of my Introduction To MIS book. Also, I finished all of the chapters (Organizational Theory And Structure, Strategic Implications Of MIS and How The MIS Affects The Organization) of my The Role Of MIS In The Organization book. Again, it isn't the most interesting of subjects; I'm not learning too much as I am already familar with the subject. But, I still need to do it. I just started the next book, Computing Resources For MIS, but I haven't gotten very far yet. At the current rate, I should still finish by October.

It was kind of nice to see the sunrise. It's especially interesting to view it through the haze. I only wished I had my camera. If I did, I could also have taken a picture of an idiotic driver I saw. This guy had 2x4's coming out of his car windows. Fortunately, they weren't sticking out enough to cause a traffic hazard. Though I wonder how well he could see his mirrors.

===================
RELAXING WEEKEND
2003-09-08 11:53:46 AM EST 
Ugh. It's Monday, again! Ah well. I had a pretty good weekend. I don't think I accomplished anything in particular though. I did get to eat at Mr. Hero. I hadn't eaten there in quite awhile. I also went to Stake n Shake. But no, I didn't spend the whole weekend eating. *L* I also watched some movies and caught up on my sleep. I think I got about ten more hours of sleep than I normally do on a weekend.

Unfortunately, I didn't get anything done on my "to-do" list. But, I needed the break and I'm glad that I took it.

===================
PHP AND XML UPDATE
2003-09-05 12:45:36 PM EST 
Well, my blog now stores all of the information as XML files and then uses PHP to render the file. Again, there wasn't a need to switch from HTML to PHP & XML except as a learning experience. Of course, now that my blog uses XML, other sites could potentially retrieve the information easier.

On a side note, I added a search function for my blog. It's got a few bugs in it. But, for the most part it works just fine.

===================
FORMATTING CHANGE
2003-09-04 05:58:30 PM EST 
I decided to use PHP and XML for my Blog. I didn't have any good reason other than wanting to learn. So, there may be some occasional problems as I work on the new format. Sorry for any inconvenience.
===================

ORACLE
2003-09-04 03:16:44 PM EST 
Okay. So I spent about an hour downloading Oracle 9i Lite. But, was that what I needed? Nope. D'oh! Now I'm downloading Oracle 9i Enterprise Edition for Linux/IA64. This looks a bit more promising.
===================

ABOUT PAGE
2003-09-04 01:04:48 PM EST 
I just added an about page for anyone who is curious about me or my site.
===================

BURNING CDS IN LINUX
2003-09-04 11:47:01 AM EST 
After downloading a copy of Oracle 9i Lite, I decided to burn it to a CD. I didn't feel like waiting through another hour-long download if I could help it. So, I put in a blank CD-R into the burner. Linux recognized it immediately. While the interface isn't very "flashy", it is simple, quick and it works! Very cool. Hopefully the Oracle install will be just as easy. Okay, so it'll probably be a bit more complicated. But, I can always hope. :)

===================
WEB SERVER
2003-09-03 05:49:24 PM EST 
Well, I finally got Apache running on the Linux machine. It took me quite a while to get it running; I kept going around in circles. I suppose that it would have been easier if I had just read the documentation. Well, I may read it eventually. But for now, I'm having too much fun.

I still have quite of bit of configuration to do. I think that my next task will be to load a copy of Oracle. I would really like to get into accessing a database from within a web page.

===================
MANAGEMENT ROLES
2003-09-02 05:07:29 PM EST 
I just finished the third chapter (Management Roles) in my MIS book (Introduction to MIS). It still isn't the most fun subject, but I'm glad that it's getting done. Hopefully, if I get through a chapter a day of each of my MIS books, I should be done by October.
