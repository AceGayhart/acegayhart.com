I *finally* got the laptop connected to the internet. In fact, I'm posting this entry from the laptop. It wasn't *too* hard. Basically, I had to move the laptop closer to my hub. After plugging in to the hub, I was online. Thanks to the DHCP service runing on my router, I didn't even have to configure the IP information on the laptop. Very nice.
