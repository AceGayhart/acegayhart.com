LED Controller: Digg the Digg Button
02/15/2008 10:01am

I was looking for some side projects when I ran across an ad on craigslist. The name sounded familiar, but I could not place it at first. Little did I realize that it was David Randolph of Systm and Revision3 fame.

Anyway, the project was to create a small program that would monitor a particular story on digg.com. It would count the number of "diggs" and send that information to an LED controller. It is probably helpful to view the episode that explains a bit more about the project.

As far as the software is concerned, it was programmed in Visual Basic .NET. As I wanted to to release this software for educational purposes, it has a lot more comments than I would normally use. It also is probably more robust than I would make it. The software demonstrates several coding techniques:

- XML comments
- Reading and saving settings to/from disk
- COM port communications
- Minimizing to an icon in the system tray
- Timers
- RegEx (Regular Expressions)
Feel free to download the software (below) and don't hesitate to ask questions.

American Diabetes Association's Tour de Cure

It is that time again to start accepting donation for the American Diabetes Association's Tour de Cure. It is essentially a cycling fundraiser for Diabetes. The 2008 event will be our third time. Rachel and I are not in great shape. But, it is a fun event and is for a good cause.
