It has been quite a while since I have written on my blog. With everything going on my life, it has been difficult to sit down to write a few paragraphs. And, much of what I would like to write is not appropriate for a public forum. You can get some glimpses from my Twitter and Facebook feeds.

After nearly a quarter century, I have beat Pharaoh's Curse! But, I am getting ahead of myself.

One Wish
Sat, 01/08/2011 - 3:57pm — James A. Gayhart
If you could be granted a single wish, what would you wish for? For some reason, this thought popped into my mind a few weeks ago as I was drifting off to sleep. I have yet to find a good answer.

My first "wish" was for a good night sleep. This, of course, was quite short sighted. Next, I thought about good health or improved finances. First I wanted these things for myself. Then, I included my wife, my close family, and my extended family. I eventually included everyone.
