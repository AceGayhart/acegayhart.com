The Tattoo

My wife Rachel is diabetic. She is supposed to advertise that fact with a medical alert bracelet or necklace so that paramedics would be better able to treat her. However, while she had some items she can wear, she either forgets to wear them or they interfere with her job. When she read an article about a kid tattooing the alert on his wrist, she was intrigued. After the passing of her dad, she wanted to honor the memory of her father. She came up with a design that combines the two ideas. Yesterday, we drove to the tattoo place where she had her other five done. It only took about an hour. I posted some pictures in the photo gallery for those who are interested. Of course, with all the talk of tattoos, I have more seriously considered getting one or two. However, I am as of yet, undecided about the design and the location.
