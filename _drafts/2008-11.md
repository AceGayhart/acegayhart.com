I Have A Pounding Headache

11/13/2008 1:05pm

One of the benefits (if you can call it that) of being unemployed is that I can sleep in. Of course, I cannot goof off all day, but I no longer have to wake up before 5:00 AM. This morning Rachel did not want to get out of bed to let the dogs out. Normally, she would let them out while I would get ready for work. Today, I figured I would let her sleep in and take the dogs out by myself.

After I got the dogs feed and back to their bed, I sent Rachel off to work and went back to bed. I do not usually set an alarm because the dogs will wake me up. However, this morning a loud pounding woke me up. The Water Department decided to fix the leak in front of our house. Do not get me wrong. I am glad they are finally fixing it. We have been complaining about it for two years. They even came out a few times to "fix" the problem. In the past, they would just tear up our tree lawn. But, this morning they decided to use a jackhammer to tear up the street. I tried to go back to sleep, but I just could not sleep through two hours of hammering.

As the hole they dug is right in front of our driveway, it looks like I am stuck at home for a bit. At least Rachel was able to get to work. Fortunately, it looks like they will be done before she is due home. Maybe I will be able to sleep in tomorrow.

Election Results 2008
11/05/2008 1:59pm
So, it looks like we have a new President. Considering how yesterday was Election Day, it is not that surprising. It is also not surprising that Barack Obama won. Looking at just the popular vote, the race could have gone either way. A half a dozen states changed their party affiliations from Republican to Democrat. It is clear that America wants a change. I hope that Obama produces a positive change. Of course, change does not happen overnight.

Happy Thanksgiving 2008

11/28/2008 9:33pm

Happy (belated) Thanksgiving! Still being unemployed, it is difficult to be thankful. However, I understand that times are tough for everyone. I am optimistic that I will be employed again shortly after the beginning of the year.

For Thanksgiving this year, Rachel and I did not do much. Rachel is not a turkey person (her meal choice would consist of grilled cheese sandwiches). So, it seemed silly to cook a turkey just for me (though I would eventually eat it all). We received an Olive Garden gift card for our anniversary. So, we got some takeout from there. In addition, we made some homemade bread sticks.

Thanksgiving should not be about the food; it should be about being thankful for what you have. I am certainly thankful for the little I have.

Happy Anniversary
11/26/2008 2:16pm
On Monday, Rachel and I celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary. Actually, "celebrated" is probably not accurate. With our current situation, it does not seem appropriate to celebrate. But, we did we did remember the event. Last night, we went to dinner with friends and family.

Squirrel vs. Kelly
11/20/2008 7:07pm
On more than one occasion, our beagles have caught a squirrel. Yesterday, we let the dogs out to go the bathroom. I looked out a minute later and Kara and Kelly were playing tug-of-war with a squirrel. I put my coat on and rushed outside to break them up. Kelly had a couple of puncture wounds on either side of her nose. Rachel and I could not tell if the squirrel bit her or if it was another dog. At any rate, we brought them inside. We tried to clean Kelly's wounds, but she would not let us. Instead of continuing to struggle with her, we just took her to the veterinarian.
