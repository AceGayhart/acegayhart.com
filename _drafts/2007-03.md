DOES ANYONE REALLY KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

I hope that everyone (in the US and Canada) "sprung forward" their clocks on Sunday. I did not have any computer problems; all of the computers' patches were up to date. But, I got a bit tired of changing all of the clocks. I think we have about eight in the kitchen alone. It seems like every new electronic device has a built in clock.

Yesterday, I went on my second business trip. It was my first trip in the corporate plane. I do not enjoy flying. But, at least I did not have to deal with any security hassles. I was able to take my tweezers, pocketknife, and fluids in excess of four ounces. It was difficult to stand, but once sitting, it was comfortable. It was a bit weird at first facing backwards. But, I got used to it. In fact, I almost did not notice the landing.
