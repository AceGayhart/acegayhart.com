On Friday, April 16, my wife and I captured an event that inadvertently became a media sensation. One of our security cameras captured a road construction accident. While attempting to cut the street with a concrete saw, the blade flew off and hit the vacant house next to us.

I posted the video for three reasons: First, it was an awesome (and terrifying) scene in every sense of the word. I think my heart skipped a beat when I saw it. I think that the operator probably had a much greater reaction.
