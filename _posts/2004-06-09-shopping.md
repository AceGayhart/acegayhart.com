Since we had some free time last night, Rachel and I decided to do some shopping. We got a cover for Kara and Kelly's crate (just for when we need to transport them). Of course we got them another toy. It's a bone-shaped tennis ball with a rope attached to it. Hopefully they'll like it. Rachel got herself some new clothes. I got a new watchband. I've got a Timex Ironman Triathlon watch. This is the first time that I can remember that the watch outlasted the watchband. I've probably had the watch for at least five years. The old band was fabric with a Velcro strap. It was okay, but it would hold water whenever I got it wet. Plus, the Velcro was wearing out. The new band is a plastic/rubber band. The band is thinner than the old one, so it fits a lot better. In fact, I slept with my watch on and I didn't even realize that I was still wearing it until I got out of the shower.

Also, we picked up a package of fireworks. I haven't lit any fireworks since New Years Day 2000. Since Ohio doesn't allow a lot of the larger fireworks without a permit (though it doesn't stop a lot of people), most of the fireworks are smoke bomb type fireworks. But, I suspect that we'll still have fun setting them off.
