I've been looking for a Commodore 64 video game. But, I don't remember what it was called. It's been over ten years since I've played it. The plot was to go into a pyramid (tomb?) and navigate from room to room. The game was a 2D adventure game. I really enjoyed playing it when I could. Unfortunately, the game was on a tape cartridge. It would take over a half hour for the game to load. Sometimes it would take several attempts before it actually ran. It's driving me crazy now that I can't remember the name.
