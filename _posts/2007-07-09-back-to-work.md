After not being in the office since June 14, it was weird going to the office today. I will have to get used to waking up early again. Falling asleep at 1:00 AM and getting up at 4:00 AM will not last long. The earliest I had been getting up for the past month had been 6:00 AM. And, with me being on vacation last week, I got up a lot later.

I also have not driven for about a month. I noticed some new billboard, and a nice chunk of my commute is newly paved. Fortunately, I did not have to deal with the construction.

It was weird once I got to the office too. It was nice to use a full-sized keyboard and a mouse again. I noticed at least a new face or two and that the mailbox slots had been reordered. As I had been working most of the time while I was away from the office, I did not have much to catch up on. I did, however, have to rip off a half of month worth of pages from my page-a-day calendar.
