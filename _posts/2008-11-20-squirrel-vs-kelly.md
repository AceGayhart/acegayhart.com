On more than one occasion, our beagles have caught a squirrel. Yesterday, we let the dogs out to go the bathroom. I looked out a minute later and Kara and Kelly were playing tug-of-war with a squirrel. I put my coat on and rushed outside to break them up. Kelly had a couple of puncture wounds on either side of her nose. Rachel and I could not tell if the squirrel bit her or if it was another dog. At any rate, we brought them inside. We tried to clean Kelly's wounds, but she would not let us. Instead of continuing to struggle with her, we just took her to the veterinarian.
