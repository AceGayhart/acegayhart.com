Last Friday, we celebrated Rachel's birthday at Yanni's (our favorite restaurant). There were probably a dozen or so people there. We ate dinner and cake. I did not take many pictures, but I did get a picture of the cake (and another picture of Rachel sticking her finger in the cake).

Aside from that, last week has been mostly quiet. I did have a slightly disturbing experience: I heard some loud noises out front. When I investigated, I found a tree trimming crew a few houses away. A few minutes later, the dogs started barking like crazy. I did not see anything out front, but I saw two men standing in the back yard! I went outside to ask them what they were doing. They said that they were from the electric company and might have to trim the branches near the power lines. Of course, I do not mind them doing the trimming. I do mind, however, that they did not ask to come onto the property and that they left the gate open. Fortunately, the dogs were inside at the time.
