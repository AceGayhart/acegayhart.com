As the weather is starting to turn, it is time to change the direction of our fan blades. However, I can never remember which way it should be blowing. So, I figured that I would write it down now. In the warmer months, the fan should be blowing down. In theory, this creates a wind-chill effect and cools you down. In the cooler months, the fan should be blowing upwards. This circulates the air without creating a wind-chill effect. Now, I no longer need to remember which direction the fans should be blowing; I just need to remember to change them. Of course, your mileage might vary.
