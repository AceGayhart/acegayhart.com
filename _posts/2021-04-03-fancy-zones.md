At home, I have a dual-monitor setup.  When writing software, I have my IDE (integrated development environment) full screen on one monitor and the resulting website or application on the other.  When recording lectures, I can have my lecture slides on one monitor and my notes on the other.  Finally, when grading assignments, I can have the student's submission on one monitor and the rubric open on the other.

While two monitors have significantly enhanced my efficiency, the reality is that I often need more than two windows open at once.  I *might* be able to add a third monitor to my desk.  (I actually miss having three monitors.)  But, sometimes, a full monitor is too much.  Windows makes it easy to snap windows to half of the screen.  But, that means I'm limited to two applications on a monitor at a time.

Enter [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones).  FancyZones is part of Microsoft's PowerToys.  It lets you define different window locations for each monitor.    They provide multiple templates, but I settled on using a 4x4 grid for each monitor.  I could have 16 small windows on a given monitor.  The power lies in expanding windows over multiple locations.

A typical setup for me is to have my primary monitor full screen or split horizontally in two.  On my secondary monitor, I have one window opened on the left side and one to three on the right side.  Effectively, I can give each application the amount of space it needs.
