I get the occasional spam and virus-infected attachment in my e-mail box everyday. Normally, that's not a big problem as I have software that filters out that junk automatically. This morning, however, I got several hundred copies of the same e-mail. It looks like an e-mail from Microsoft telling you to update your system. Included with the e-mail is the W32.Swen.A@mm virus. To make matters worse, each of the e-mails is about 100k. Needless to say, this significantly slows down my mail checking.

I urge everyone to make sure their operating system has the latest patches. Also, you should be running a firewall and anti-virus software. Additionally, it would be nice if you run an intrusion detection system.
