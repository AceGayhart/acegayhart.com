Since it's summer again, Rachel decided to plant some strawberry popcorn again. Out of four seeds only one plant survived. That is until very recently. Kara had decided that it must have been food so she jumped into the flowerpot and ate most of the plant. I suppose we can try again next year.

Last night, while Rachel and I were out walking the dogs, we noticed that our neighbor had put a computer to the curb. It looked decent enough, but we had our hands full at the moment. This morning I saw that was still sitting there amongst the other trash so I decided to bring it inside. I was surprised when it booted right away. In fact, I was surprised absolutely nothing on it had been erased. There were prior tax returns and other financial information on the hard drive. Fortunately for my neighbor, I'm not the type of person to take advantage of this. So, I will shred the hard drive.

I'm not sure what to do with the computer. It's a 366 Mhz AMD-K6 with a four-gigabyte hard drive and 32 megabytes of RAM. Plus it's got a floppy and CD-ROM drive. Maybe I'll just use it as a test system or something.
