We put our first ornament on our tree. It says "First Christmas In Our New Home 2003". I think that this was very appropriate for our first ornament. The rest of the ornaments, however, will most likely be Tigger-related.

One of my good friends is named Roy. He's known for being a bit on the zany side. So, when my wife and I were driving around the other day and noticed a sign that said "Karaoke With Roy" we took a picture of it for him.

Tagline for today: "The guy [Osama bin Laden] inherited $80 million at age 13 and has since expanded it to $300 million through construction, smart investing, and gas and oil investments. This way, he can use the money in his war against capitalism." - Jay Leno
