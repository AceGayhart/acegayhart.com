Well, today was the first day that I had to shovel snow. About half of the driveway had about an inch or two of power. The remainder of the stuff (what I'm shoveling in the picture) is mostly slush. Hopefully now the tire tracks won't turn to ice. It should also be a lot easier getting to and from the garage now. Besides, after all of the food I consumed over the Thanksgiving holiday, I probably need some additional exercise.

Tagline for today: "While I was gone, somebody rearranged all the furniture in my bedroom. They put it in exactly the same place it was. When I told my roommate, he said: 'Do I know you?'" - Steven Wright
