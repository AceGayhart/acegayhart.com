One of my resolutions for this year was to ease back into my exercise program. This week I added strength training (weight lifting) and started with the lightest weights that I have. I can easily lift more weight, but limiting the weight and repetitions will help prevent me from overdoing it. Obviously, I will increase the weight and repetitions at steady intervals until I hit my max. Then, I will do increases in weights and/or repetitions as I become stronger.

It was a bit weird lifting weights again. Even though I purposely limited myself, a few times I went beyond the number of repetitions. After doing more repetitions for so long, it was hard to break my old habit.

This week, I also tried a new drink: A Bloody Mary. Instead of making my own mix from scratch, I bought a ready-made mix. I only had to add some vodka. The drink was okay, but it needed a bit of a kick. Several dashes of Tabasco did the trick.

Tagline for today: If life deals you lemons, make lemonade. If it deals you tomatoes, make Bloody Mary's. But if it deals you a truckload of hand grenades...now...THAT'S a message!!
