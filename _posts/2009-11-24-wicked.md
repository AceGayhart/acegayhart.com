To celebrate our eighth wedding anniversary, my wife and I went to see Wicked at Playhouse Square. Both of us had read "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" (which parallels "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"). The story follows the Wicked Witch of the West (Elphaba), her sister, the Wicked Witch of the East (Nessarose), and the Good Witch of the North (Galinda/Glinda). The story also shows how the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow came to be.

As neither of us had been to Playhouse Square, it took a bit to figure out exactly where we need to park and sit. We did have a small problem getting to our seats. But, once we sat down, everything was fine. Fortunately, unlike most movies I have viewed in a theater, most of the audience was quiet (except for appropriate amounts of laughter and applause).

Afterward, we had a three-course meal at The Melting Pot. Like most of our meals there, this one was good. Typically, we include the main course. But, the salad, cheese, and chocolate courses were more than sufficient.

Overall, it was a wonderful day.
