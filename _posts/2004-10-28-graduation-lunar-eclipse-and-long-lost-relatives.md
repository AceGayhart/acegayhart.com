Yesterday was Kara and Kelly's last day of advanced training classes. They both got diplomas. Like last time, they got their pictures taken as well. The upper-left corner shows Rachel and myself holding Kelly. The lower-right corner shows the two of us holding Kara. The other two pictures show the other classmates. The dog on the left is called "Harrison"; the dog on the right is called "Jack". Now, the only thing left is for Kara and Kelly to take the Canine Good Citizen test. The next available testing date isn't until next year. So in the meantime, we'll keep practicing for it. Since we didn't want to leave Emily out of the "fun", we'll be starting her basic training in a few weeks.

Last night, in addition to being a full moon, there was a total lunar eclipse. Even though there was some heavy cloud cover, Rachel and I were able to take a few videos. At one point, the moon turned from white, to a dark orange color. I thought that was appropriate as Halloween is just around the corner. Hopefully our pictures turned out well, as the next eclipse of this nature won't be until 2007.

Recently, I had begun searching for my natural father. It has been probably ten or fifteen years since I heard from him. Anyway, I finally heard from him (and my step-mom) last week. It was great to catch up with them. So many things have happened since the last time we all had talked. Now, that we've connected once again, hopefully we will maintain that connection indefinitely.
