Recently, Rachel and I received mail stating we won a contest. Considering the recent problems with our bank account, we initially thought it was a fraud. But, after doing some research, we found that it was indeed legitimate.

Anyway, we won WEOL's "Anniversary Couple of the Day." The price was a floral arrangement from Puffer's Floral Shoppe. This morning I went to pick it up. It was a mug with some lovely flowers. Even though we already thanked the person who entered us into the contest, I wanted to thank them publicly. So, Thank You!
