Well, it has been nearly a week and the new dogs are starting to settle in nicely. They're still not quite housebroken, but they haven't made a mess in the house within the last few days. Of course, they're probably making a mess while I'm writing this. All of the dogs are starting to play together and, as you can see in the picture, they don't mind lying on the bed together.

Tagline for today: "I broke my arm trying to fold a bed. It wasn't the kind that folds." - Steven Wright
