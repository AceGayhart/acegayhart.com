The room should have a warm, inviting atmosphere, with the focus on the back of the couple as they are engrossed in a movie on a screen out of view. Include elements like a comfortable sofa, a bowl of popcorn, soft blankets, ambient lighting, and a feeling of intimacy and contentment. The setting should evoke a sense of relaxation and togetherness, suitable for a blog about personal experiences and holidays spent at home.

This past week was Thanksgiving in the US and, for my wife and I, our twenty-second anniversary. Many people travel and visit family and friends this time of year. While we agreed we could use a break, we weren't too keen to travel at this time of year.

As mundane as it sounds, we opted to stay home this year. I was due for a vacation. Though I would get Thursday and Friday off for the holiday, I took off the entire week. Instead of having a traditional Thanksgiving meal, we decided to have holiday foods throughout the week.

For entertainment, we worked through our backlog of movie and streaming wishlists. I lost track of everything we watched, but my popcorn machine got quite the workout. I even went through all the specialty popcorn kernels. (Aside from a noticeable color difference in the kernels and a slight color difference when popped, we didn't notice any taste or texture differences).

Notwithstanding our overindulgence in popcorn, sweets, and media, we had an enjoyable week.
