In my [last post](/2023/04/24/updates), I talked about writing a spam processing application with the aid of ChatGPT. That code is now available on my [GitHub site](https://github.com/AceGayhart/Spam). While I didnâ€™t create it to make it available for public use, I figured someone could use parts of the code or its entirety. Regardless, I hope that someone finds it helpful, and I gladly accept feedback on the code.
