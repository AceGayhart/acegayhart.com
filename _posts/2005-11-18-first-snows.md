Yesterday, we got our first snows of the cold weather season. While the Snow Belt just east of us got six to eight inches, we only received flurries. Rachel kept bugging me to write something about it in my blog. For me, it does not count as snow until it gets to the point where it sticks to the ground (and it needs to be shoveled). It is like comparing moss to salad. Sure, there are loads of similarities, but that does not mean that I am going to give up lettuce.

It is interesting to note, however, that just a few days ago our average temperature was in the fifties and sixties. Now, it is in the thirties. It is just one more reason why I work from home.

Tagline for today: "I once tried to commit suicide by jumping off a building. I changed my mind at the last minute, so I just flipped over and landed on my feet. Two little kittens nearby saw what happened and one turns to the other and says, 'See? That's how it's done.'" - Steven Wright
