I've got a cute dog (Beagle/Springer mix) that just loves to chase the squirrels in my back yard. She'll walk out very slowly. Sometimes she almost crawls on her belly. She only moves when the squirrels aren't watching her. Then, when she's close enough, she pounces! She hasn't caught a squirrel yet. But, it's still very fun and interesting to watch.
