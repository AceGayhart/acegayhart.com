Yesterday, after work, I was sitting outside with the dogs. When Rachel came home from work, I asked if she wanted to take the dogs for a walk. She said that she did not mind. She went inside to grab the leashes and came back outside. As soon as she shut the door, she asked if I had my house keys on me. Unfortunately, neither of us had our keys. We look the dogs for their walk and then went back to try to get into the house.

When we got back home, we had discovered that nearly all of our windows were locked (as they should be) with the safety latch (it prevents the window from being opened more than a few inches). I tried reaching through one of the windows to grab a phone, but I only succeed in knocking the phone out of reach and hurting my arm. In fact, my arm is still hurting today. I ended up just going through the bathroom window.

To (hopefully) prevent this from happening again, Rachel got a duplicate key today. The key looks like it was cut from leopard's skin. At least she will have no problems figuring out which key is the house key.
