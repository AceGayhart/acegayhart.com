Rachel and I went out to lunch today. I had received a gift card to a local restaurant. Unfortunately, they were closed today. But, it was okay. Rachel and I had a good meal at a different restaurant.

I am happy that the correct sized screws for my chair finally arrived. Ten minutes of assembly time, and my new chair was put together. The fabric is a tiger print. It would probably look better in Rachel's "Tigger Room." But, the main point is that it is comfortable and it works.

Tagline for today: "Why does Sea World have a seafood restaurant? I'm halfway through my fish burger and I realize, Oh my Goodness... I could be eating a slow learner." - Lynda Montgomery
