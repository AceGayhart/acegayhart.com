Well, it's been just over a year since my wife and I moved from California. So far, most everything has been going great. There have been the occasional problems, but that's to be expected. It's been a bit weird working out of the house. The downside is that I don't have a lot of face-to-face contact with other people. Of course, there are several upsides:

I've got a rather short commute (walking upstairs). It doesn't matter what I wear to work. On warm days like today, I can go to work barefoot and wearing shorts. I can customize my office space however I like (so long as my wife doesn't object). If I want, I can work in near-total darkness with only black lights on.

After trying to get CenturyTel to reduce my DSL price, I decided to switch to cable from Adelphia. The cable is normal faster than my DSL connection. However, the DSL connection speed rarely fluctuated. I was annoyed with Adelphia when I got my cable modem. When I signed up, I was told that I was getting a cable modem that had routing capabilities. This means that I didn't have to purchase an additional router for my network. Instead I got a very basic cable modem. I ended up buying a small (but nice) Linksys router. Now that everything is plugged in and working, I think I can finally clean up my office. I was in the midst of rearranging when I started to reinstall Windows. Then, I had to deal with the cable connection. Now, I should be able to put everything back in its place.

It's been nearly a month since we got Kara and Kelly. They are still doing pretty good. Kelly is being treated for tapeworm, but other than that she's okay. Also, both of them are slowly starting to put some weight on. Last night, we took them to my parents-in-law's house to stay for a bit. Everything went good (at least they didn't make a mess in the house).
