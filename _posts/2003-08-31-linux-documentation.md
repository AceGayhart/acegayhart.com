I'm not normally the type of person to read a manual when starting on something. I like to first get my hands "dirty" and then go back to the manual. Now that I've started to get my hands dirty with Linux, I'm starting to read the user manual. Unfortunately, the manual is on-line (I generally prefer a paper manual). However, the on-line version is definitely a lot cheaper (and more "environment-friendly") than a paper manual.
