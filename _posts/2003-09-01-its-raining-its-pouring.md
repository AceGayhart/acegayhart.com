But I'm not asleep (though I do snore). :) The National Weather Service recently issued a flood watch for my area. A flood means lots of rain, right? We'll you'd think so. But at the moment, it isn't even sprinkling here. Apparently, there's a gap in the rain right where I live. Now, I don't really want things to be flooded, but some rain would be nice. In the meantime, could someone take the weather map off of the corner of my TV screen?
