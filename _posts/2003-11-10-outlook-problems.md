Lately, I've been having problems with Microsoft Outlook. I wanted to modify Outlook today (the startup page). However, each time I clicked on the Customize Outlook Today button nothing happened. After spending some time troubleshooting the problem I finally ended up just reinstalling it. That definitely fixed the problem. Of course, after I applied the first service pack I started to have the same problem again. I decided that it was worth my time to get it working again. Besides, I don't have any other problems with Outlook. I did spend a few hours applying all of the latest patches. That should keep it up to date for at least a few days.
