"What walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, And makes a slinkity sound?" A Slinky of course! At my desk at work I have a small slinky collection (about a dozen). Last night Rachel and were browsing the Target Company Store. I have a Target-branded self-stirring mug that is gradually wearing down. I was looking for a replacement (which I could not find) when I found a Target-branded Slinky! I sprung into action and ordered one.
