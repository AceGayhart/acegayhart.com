I use CenturyTel as my internet provider. A few days ago, I noticed that I stopped getting posts on their news server. I sent them an e-mail asking what was up. Here's their response:

> We are sorry to hear about the problems you are having with our newsfeed. Unfortunately, the company that was providing our newsfeed is no longer in that business. We are currently looking for another news provider. We apologize that we were not able to give advance notice to our customers, but we weren't given any warning either. At this time, we are not sure how long it will take before we find another news provider. I understand they already have some they are dealing with now. If there is anything else that we can do for you just let us know.

Okay. I can understand why they couldn't give advance notice, but what about giving notice when they lost their feed?
