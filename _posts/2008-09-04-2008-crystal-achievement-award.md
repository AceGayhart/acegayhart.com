Recently, Window & Door Magazine awarded my employer, GED Integrated Solutions, the 2008 Crystal Achievement Award for "Most Innovative Machine." It was for our i3 Smartload Welding System.

Members of the project team received their own personalized award. It is a piece of curved and beveled glass with "2008 Crystal Achievement Award," "i3 Smartload Welding System," our name, and the company's logo. It is beautiful, but is unfortunately difficult to photograph. I placed it on the shelf above my desk.
