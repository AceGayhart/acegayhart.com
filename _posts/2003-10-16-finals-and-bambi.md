I had a pretty good day yesterday. I spent most of the morning taking final exams. Now, I just have to finish my final project to get my degree. I would like to get it all done before the end of the year. Since I had an abundance of vacation time, I decided to take a few weeks off to work on my project.

For lunch I went to the Golden Corral with my wife and mother-in-law. It is a buffet-style restaurant. Consequently, we got very, very full. It was the first time I had been there. It's a fairly nice place to eat.

For dinner, I had some venison burgers. I think that I've had venison before, but I don't remember. Anyway, they were probably the best burgers that I've had in awhile. I know that some of you out there probably consider me a "Bambi killer". I'd just like to point out that Bambi didn't die in the movie. Bambi's mother, on the other hand, is a different story. (I'm just kidding. Geez!) On a related side note, it is quite interesting to note that Bambi is usually a female's name. However, in the movie Bambi is male (the female deer is called Faline). By the way, my favorite character in the movie is Thumper. "'Eating clovers is a special treat, It makes long ears and great big feet. But it sure is awful stuff to eat.' I made that last part up myself."
