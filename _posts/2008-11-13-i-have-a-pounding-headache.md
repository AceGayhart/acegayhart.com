One of the benefits (if you can call it that) of being unemployed is that I can sleep in. Of course, I cannot goof off all day, but I no longer have to wake up before 5:00 AM. This morning Rachel did not want to get out of bed to let the dogs out. Normally, she would let them out while I would get ready for work. Today, I figured I would let her sleep in and take the dogs out by myself.

After I got the dogs feed and back to their bed, I sent Rachel off to work and went back to bed. I do not usually set an alarm because the dogs will wake me up. However, this morning a loud pounding woke me up. The Water Department decided to fix the leak in front of our house. Do not get me wrong. I am glad they are finally fixing it. We have been complaining about it for two years. They even came out a few times to "fix" the problem. In the past, they would just tear up our tree lawn. But, this morning they decided to use a jackhammer to tear up the street. I tried to go back to sleep, but I just could not sleep through two hours of hammering.

As the hole they dug is right in front of our driveway, it looks like I am stuck at home for a bit. At least Rachel was able to get to work. Fortunately, it looks like they will be done before she is due home. Maybe I will be able to sleep in tomorrow.
