There was supposed to be a lunar eclipse tonight. However, due to the thick cloud cover, I didn't get to see any of it. Fortunately, there will be two more next year. After that, there will be a "drought" until 2007.

We spent part of today getting some Christmas decorations. The main thing that we bought was a six-foot fiber optic Christmas tree. It looks very cool. Also, we apparently had some snow flurries today. At least that's what my wife kept telling me. She kept trying to point out each snowflake when she saw them. I think that she was just pulling my chain. I didn't see any.
