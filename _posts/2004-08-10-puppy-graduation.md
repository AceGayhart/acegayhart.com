Yesterday was Kara and Kelly's last class of basic puppy training. Their final command is BOW. When they bow, they lay down on their front two paws while keeping their rear in the air. So now, in addition to BOW, they know SIT, STAY (for up to 30 seconds), DOWN, COME and LEAVE IT. They still need continual practice of course. I got an additional dog splitter and a stronger leash so I can take all three dogs for a walk at the same time.

Both Kelly and Kara got certificates of achievement and a picture of them wearing graduation caps. Rachel and I are now considering taking them to the advanced class. However, we feel that both them and us need a break. Also, we want to take Emily through the same training as well.

Yesterday was an especially "ruff" day for them: We had to hold onto them and hold their graduation caps on for four pictures. Once we were done with the class, we noticed that PETsMART had a professional photographer there. So, Kara and Kelly had to set for another ten pictures. But, they did well for the most part. I'll post pictures as soon as we get them back.

Tagline for today: "I was in the grocery store. I saw a sign that said pet supplies. So I did. Then I went outside and saw a sign that said compact cars." - Steven Wright
