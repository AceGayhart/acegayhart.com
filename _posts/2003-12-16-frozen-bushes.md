Yesterday was an interesting day temperature-wise. The temperature would go a few degrees above freezing for a bit and then drop back down below freezing. The nature result was icicles. Along the roof's edge, we had icicles that were five or six inches long and were up to a half-inch in diameter. As my wife and I were inspecting the roof, trying to get a good picture, we noticed that the bushes in front of our house didn't look quite right. Upon closer inspection, we had found that snow from the roof and the top of the bushes had melted and refrozen. There were more icicles on the bushes than were on the house. In fact, the front of most of the bushes had several layers of icicles and had since become frozen solid!
