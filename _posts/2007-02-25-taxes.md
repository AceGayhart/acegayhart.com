I got most of our taxes filled today. Well, at least I thought I did. Shortly after I had sent in the returns electronically, I got an e-mail that they were rejected. It turns out that I had mistypes Rachel's birthday. I was worried that I had made a bigger mistake. When I was filling out the forms, I was going to deduct the sales taxes that I had paid on our Durango. It was not until I was reviewing the forms that I realized that we bought the Durango in 2005, not 2006. Ah well. At least I did not send out the forms with that mistake.
