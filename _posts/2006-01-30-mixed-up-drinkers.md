Lately Rachel and I have been experimenting with some mixed drinks. Last week we tried some strawberry-rum-vodka concoction. The drink tasted okay, but we had a heck of a time trying to make it. If someone else was watching they would have thought we were already drunk. The instructions were simple: Pour in so many ounces of the mix, and so many cups of ice, turn on the blender, and enjoy. Well, apparently the instructions were too difficult for us. We got the mix all over the counter. And, I am not sure how it happened, but I got an ice cube in our toaster. Fortunately, aside from aches from laughing too hard, neither of us was harmed.

So far, my favorite drink is the screwdriver (orange juice and vodka). I especially enjoy adding some ice and making a screwdriver smoothie.
