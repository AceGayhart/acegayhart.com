The company that I work for doesn't allow me to carry over vacation years from one year to the next. Consequently, I am taking Wednesdays off for the rest of the year just to burn up my vacation days. Today was my first day off. I was looking forward to sleeping in this morning. However, the dogs decided to get up at 4:00 AM. After we brought them back inside, I tried going to sleep, but it didn't last long. I got a couple of calls from work. I figured that I might as well just stay up.

Later, I got a call from my reenrollment advisor from Saint Leo. She wanted to know if I was ready to register for the next term. The current term started on Monday, so I thought that it was a bit early to register. However, since the terms are only eight weeks long, I figured that I might as well get registered. My next class will be an algebra class. I'm fairly good with algebra, but since it's been ten years since my last class, I thought that a refresher class would be a good idea.

As I said earlier, I have started my next class, Basic Composition Skills, at SLU. There was a little SNAFU with my registration, so I wasn't able to log into my class until 5:30 PM. I'm glad that I'm taking Wednesdays off; I'll probably need the extra homework time.

Today is Kelly and Kara's last day of advanced training. We are going to have a slightly larger ceremony than when they finished their basic training. Near the end of their basic training, everyone else either quit the class or moved to a different time slot. So, only Kara and Kelly were in the last several classes. For tonight's ceremony, there will be two other dogs. It should be fun.

Last night, Rachel and I finished raking and picking up all of the leaves in the backyard. The yard looked nice...for a while. When I looked out this morning, it looked like we hadn't even raked. In fact, it seemed like it was raining leaves. Ah well, it will give us something to do for the weekend.
