My in-laws came over today to help remove two air conditioners. Also, my father in law helped to repair my staircase railing. A few weeks ago, I had a nasty fall down the stairs that made the railing too loose to be used safely. I think that I hurt my pride more than anything else. I suppose that I shouldn't wear socks any more as I run down the stairs. My only regret (besides not falling of course) is not having a video camera handy to catch the incident. I imagine that it would have looked pretty funny.
