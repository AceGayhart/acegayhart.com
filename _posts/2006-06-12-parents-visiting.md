Recently, my mom Ellen, step dad Fred, and nephew Cody, flew out to California to pay Rachel and I a visit. While they were only here for a few short days, we did manage to have some fun. We visited the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame Museum, the Great Lakes Science Center, and, of course, Cold Stone Creamery. In addition, we visited several different shops and areas of town. While I wish they could have stayed longer, it was nice that they were finally able to see our house and I look forward to seeing them again.
