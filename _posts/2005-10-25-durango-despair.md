Recently, we took our Durango for its first oil change. Even though we had some issues with Wal-Mart before, we took another chance and had them do the oil change. Rachel dropped the Durango off and told them to change the wiper blades as well. A few moments later, they paged Rachel to go back to the oil station. They had some issues with the rear wiper.

They gave Rachel a chunk of twisted metal and told her that our rear wiper was broken. They said that the wiper was broken before we brought it in. They were guessing that the prior owner must have broken the wiper. Then, the prior owner must have rigged the wiper so it would work again.

I did not quite believe them especially since they broke our emergency brake release on our Dakota. But, at least this time they said they would pay any repairs if we could prove that they broke the wiper. A quick trip to the local Dodge dealership confirmed that Wal-Mart was responsible for the damage. Well, at any rate they broke the wiper blade. The rest of the wiper was just fine. I guess next time we need an oil change we will go somewhere else.

Since we were already at the Dodge dealership, we picked up some accessories that I had ordered earlier. Among them was a cargo net. I was getting ready to install it when I got to the step were some drilling was required. As I did not have a drill handy, I decided to postpone the installation for another day.
