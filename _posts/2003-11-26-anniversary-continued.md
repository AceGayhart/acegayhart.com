On Monday night, my parents-in-law took my wife and I to Olive Garden. I think that's the first time that I've ever eaten there (I don't remember). Anyways, the food was great. I had their Tour of Italy. It consists of homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana, and creamy fettuccine alfredo. I also had their salad and breadsticks. To finish off the meal, I had a nice slice of pumpkin cheesecake. Mmmm.

On a completely different and unrelated note, my father-in-law gave me a large basketball-shaped mug filled with Slim Jims. There's probably about fifty of them. Since they probably won't last the weekend, I think I'll need to do some extra exercising this week.
