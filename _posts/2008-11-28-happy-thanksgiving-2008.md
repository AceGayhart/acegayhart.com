Happy (belated) Thanksgiving! Still being unemployed, it is difficult to be thankful. However, I understand that times are tough for everyone. I am optimistic that I will be employed again shortly after the beginning of the year.

For Thanksgiving this year, Rachel and I did not do much. Rachel is not a turkey person (her meal choice would consist of grilled cheese sandwiches). So, it seemed silly to cook a turkey just for me (though I would eventually eat it all). We received an Olive Garden gift card for our anniversary. So, we got some takeout from there. In addition, we made some homemade bread sticks.

Thanksgiving should not be about the food; it should be about being thankful for what you have. I am certainly thankful for the little I have.
