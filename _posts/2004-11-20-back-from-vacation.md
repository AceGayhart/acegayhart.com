I have been on vacation this past week. Rachel and I went up to Casino Windsor to celebrate our third wedding anniversary. The trip there took about four hours. The major delay was the route we took. Instead of taking the Ohio Turnpike most of the way there, we took Route 2. Route 2 follows Lake Erie's shoreline for the most part. The scenery was nice, but had I known that the speed limit would drop from 65 to 35, I wouldn't have taken Route 2. Even after getting delayed at the border and stopping for food and gas, it only took us about three hours to get home. Now we know which way to go in the future.

Shortly after arriving at our room, room service came and delivered us a package. It contained a bottle of Chardonnay, a couple of wine glasses, a fruit basket, some sparkling mineral water and a box of chocolates. This was my first time tasting wine. The first few sips were okay, but after awhile it left a bad taste in my mouth. I think that it was a combination of the grapes that I was eating and me getting too much sun from the drive.

We did okay when we were gambling. Rachel won over seventy dollars on a nickel slot by hitting the "Big Kahuna" bonus. I won $165 on a "Price Is Right" nickel slot and I won $360 on a "Monopoly" nickel slot. Also, I doubled my money in a session of blackjack. Of course, all of our winnings found their way back to other table games or slot machines. The main thing is that we had a great time.

The only downside from our vacation is that we eventually had to come home. When I finally got around to checking my e-mail, I had well over 500 e-mails that had to sift through. I'm done reading all of my e-mail, but I still have quite a few to respond to. Also, I have a bit of catching up to do on my schoolwork. At least next week will be a short week.
