Today I started my last class for the year. It is another English class. As English is not my favorite subject, I usually dread the classes. Fortunately, the class is only eight weeks long. So, if the class ends up being complete misery, I will not have to endure it for long. Seriously, as long as I keep up with the assignments, I feel that the class will okay.
