I've been using a mail-sorting program called POPFile for the last couple of weeks. So far it's been great. Since I last reset the statistics (on 11/16/2003), it has been 98.66% accurate. Out of just over 600 e-mails, it only misclassified eight e-mails. I think that's pretty good. As an interesting statistic, about half of my e-mail (52.84%) is spam.
