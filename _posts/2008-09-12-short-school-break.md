On last Saturday, I turned in the last final for my classes this term. I am happy to state that I received an "A" for all three classes this term. This means that I will continue to maintain my 4.0 GPA (grade point average). Now, I am down to fifteen more classes before I earn my Bachelor's degree. If I continue to take the maximum of three classes at a time, I will be done around June. In the meantime, I will enjoy this short break until the next term starts this coming Wednesday.
