I am still trying to catch up from my recent vacation. I had several pages of material to write for my blog. I had written a number of entries on the trip to the West Coast, but somewhere along the way, I got behind. When I was starting to post entries, I realized that I should take into account from which time zone I am posting.

So, I had to modify my blogging software to handle multiple time zones. Then, I realized that I needed to take into account Daylight Saving Time. Between these new changes and every thing else going on, it took me about a month until I was able to incorporate the changes.

As if changing my blogging software was not bad enough, I had problems with my photo gallery. On our recent vacation, Rachel and I took well over six hundred pictures. Unfortunately, my photo gallery software cannot handle that many pictures. Until I come up with a better solution, I will not be able to add any more pictures.

A few days after we got home, I got a call from my step mom, Norma. She told me that my father, Jimmy, had a few heart attacks. Apparently, he had a heart attack at work. He also had another heart attack in the ambulance and in the emergency room. He is still recovering, but he is doing much better.

For a while, I thought I would lose him. But, I was happy that if he did pass away, I at least was able to see him. Now, I am concerned that heart attacks may be in my future. The only thing I can do is to continue to exercise on a regular basis and try to eat healthy.
