Last night when Rachel and I were watching TV, the wind started to howl. I think that we were getting gusts of up to fifty miles an hour. In addition, the temperature dropped at least five degrees in as many minutes. When, I got up this morning, there was hardly any snow on the ground. However, through the course of the day, we got at least two inches of snow. I guess that once you start to shovel snow, you know that winter's upon you.

Other than shoveling snow (which I usually enjoy), I had some problems with our Christmas decorations. Rachel and I put up two inflatable Tiggers. Since it is not recommended to run them for more than eight hours, we unplug them every night. When I went to plug them in this afternoon, they were buried in the snow. In fact, one of the Tiggers even had an icicle or two. It took a few moments before I could finally get them inflated. I also did a bit of rewiring. As I don't really enjoy going outside to turn them off, I got everything attached to a timer. Also, I put in new extension cords. I had been using one that was at least a hundred feet (it was the smallest one I had).
