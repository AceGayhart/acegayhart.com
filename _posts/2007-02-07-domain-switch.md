I finally got my domain name, silverjaguar.com, switched to a new web-hosting provider. I liked old provider, but as they did not offer discounts for multiple domains, I needed to switch. I like my new provider a lot better. I hope that no one is having problems (hopefully no one even noticed the changeover). Let me know if you have any problems or questions.

Tagline for today: "I went down the street to the 24-hour grocery. When I got there, the guy was locking the front door. I said, 'Hey, the sign says you're open 24-hours.' He said, 'Yeah, but not in a row.'" - Steven Wright
