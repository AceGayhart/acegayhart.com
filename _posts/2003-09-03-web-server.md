Well, I finally got Apache running on the Linux machine. It took me quite a while to get it running; I kept going around in circles. I suppose that it would have been easier if I had just read the documentation. Well, I may read it eventually. But for now, I'm having too much fun.

I still have quite of bit of configuration to do. I think that my next task will be to load a copy of Oracle. I would really like to get into accessing a database from within a web page.
