We also created holiday fare. But, instead of a single, gut-busting meal, I'm grateful that we spread the food out over the week.

I'm also grateful that I have a job where I can take time off. Too often in my career, I have let my vacation and sick time go unused. I'm attempting to be better about taking breaks.
