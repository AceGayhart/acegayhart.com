My birthday was last month. I don't particularly appreciate celebrating it because it tends to be overshadowed or grouped with other celebrations. For example, with its closeness to Mother's Day, the holiday was usually the focus. When my younger sister was born on my seventh birthday, there were group celebrations from that point forward. And when my mom died a few days before a recent birthday, that brings a sad note to the time of year.

This year, we also had a delayed, joint celebration. Fortunately, the weather was nice enough to sit outside to eat and share gifts. When it comes to gifts, I realize that I am a difficult person when buying gifts. People think they know what I want and often give thoughtful gifts. But what I receive sometimes matches what I desire.

Part of the problem is that I don't clearly communicate what I want. The other part of the problem is that I tend to buy what I want before others have the chance to. This year, I got more organized and created a wishlist. When I found something I desired, instead of purchasing it, I added it to the wishlist.

While I wasn't planning a theme, most of my gifts were plant-related. My first gift arrived before my birthday. Because it was living, my wife opted to give it early.

It is an [*Othonna Capensis*](https://amzn.to/3VxB6dZ), also called a "Ruby Necklace." Though I like the "String of Pickles" nickname. It'll fit nicely in my office with the other plants.

Next, I got a set of [LEGO Succulents](https://amzn.to/3ySjd0V). They took me a few hours to put together.

{% include image name="img_0904.jpg" caption="Aloe Vera (*Aloe barbadensis miller*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0911.jpg" caption="Hens and Chicks (*Sempervivum tectorum*)" %}

This one didn't have a name, so I'm taking a guess:

{% include image name="img_0912.jpg" caption="Lola Echeveria (*Echeveria 'Lola'*)" %}

But, it holds a secret inside. Those are spare locking pins to connect each plant.

{% include image name="img_0905.jpg" caption="Moon Cactus (*Gymnocalycium mihanovichii*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0909.jpg" caption="Ball Cactus (*Parodia magnifica*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0906.jpg" caption="Burro's Tail (*Sedum morganianum*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0914.jpg" caption="Red Echeveria (*Echeveria 'Fireball'*)" %}

While the plants can be connected in a number of ways, here is the one from the instruction manual:

I also got a set of [LEGO Tiny Plants](https://amzn.to/3ySQwAR)

{% include image name="img_0917.jpg" caption="False Shamrock (*Oxalis triangularis*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0918.jpg" caption="Jade Plant (*Crassula ovata*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0919.jpg" caption="Laceleaf (*Anthurium andraeanum*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0920.jpg" caption="Venus Flytrap (*Dionaea muscipula*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0921.jpg" caption="Red Sundew (*Drosera brevifolia*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0922.jpg" caption="Yellow Pitcher Plant (*Sarracenia flava*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0923.jpg" caption="Eastern Prickly Pear (*Opuntia humifusa*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0924.jpg" caption="Britton's Liveforever (*Dudleya brittonii*)" %}
{% include image name="img_0925.jpg" caption="Pincushion Cactus (*Mammillaria crinita f. zeilmanniana*)" %}

Now that everything's assembled, the biggest challenge will be figuring out where to put them in my office. üòÅ
