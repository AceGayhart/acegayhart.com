Well, we've got our first icicle, three of them actually. Okay. So they're only about a quarter inch in length. But they're still our first. It was about 60 degrees this morning. Then it dropped to about 35 degrees. We had rain earlier in the morning so any drops that didn't fall off the windowsill ended up freezing.
