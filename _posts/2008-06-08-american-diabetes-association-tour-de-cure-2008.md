Rachel and I recently go back from the American Diabetes Association's Tour de Cure. This is the third year that we have done the bicycle ride. Like last year, it was at Blossom Music Center. And, like usual, we were unprepared for the ride. Except for a few days ago, we have not ridden our bikes since last year's ride. The ride was only supposed to be 10K. But, with the weather in the nineties, the heat was too much for a number of people. When we reached the halfway point, Rachel said she was done. It is probably a good thing too. I do not know how much longer I would have lasted. I am still having pains from my treadmill incident a few months ago.

Even though this year's ride is over, it is not too late to donate.
