A few days ago, my mom called to say I received some official-looking notice via the mail. She forwarded over to me. It was a form to determine my eligibility for jury duty. While I would not mind serving again, I cannot afford to fly from Ohio to California to do so. I am sure they will accept my "excuse" for not being eligible.
