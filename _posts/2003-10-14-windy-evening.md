Well, after spending the other day picking up leaves, I'm a bit sad to say that there's more on the ground today. Of course, this was expected. We've got five oak trees on our property. Plus most of our neighbors have trees on their property as well. I didn't expect quite so many in this short amount of time though. With wind gusts up to fifty miles an hour, I shouldn't have been surprised. However, I was a bit surprised that our Halloween-themed leaf bags rolled all over our property. I guess that we'll have to get some larger (heavier) bags.
