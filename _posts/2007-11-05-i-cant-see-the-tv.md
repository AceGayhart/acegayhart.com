I just received the following e-mail from Dell about a TV we had purchased from them a few years ago:

We have determined that your W2600 Dell LCD TV is included in a limited number of Dell TVs that may exhibit a no power issue. The no power symptoms are no video, no sound, and the power indicator is off. The no power issue does not affect general television use once the TV is switched on.

So, if I understand the e-mail correctly, the TV does not function when it is turned off. Yeah, I didn't get it. I did a search online and found that it might be an overheating issue and that it simply fails to turn on. Though my TV (currently) does not have this problem, I wish they could have worded the e-mail better.
