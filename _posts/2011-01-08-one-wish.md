If you could be granted a single wish, what would you wish for? For some reason, this thought popped into my mind a few weeks ago as I was drifting off to sleep. I have yet to find a good answer.

My first "wish" was for a good night's sleep. This, of course, was quite short-sighted. Next, I thought about good health or improved finances. First, I wanted these things for myself. Then, I included my wife, my close family, and my extended family. I eventually included everyone.
