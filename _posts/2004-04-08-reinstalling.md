Grr... I've got a Windows 98 SE machine that I've used for several years. I have only had one problem with it that is until now. Lately, it has been locking up and the most inconvenient spots. It's getting to the point where I can't run more than two programs at the same time. I usually leave Outlook and Trillian open all the time. However, I now have to close either or both of these programs if I want to run something else. At first I suspected a virus or malware. But, after running scans for both, I came up empty. I'm now suspecting that a recent patch to one of the programs I use is causing the problems. However, it's quicker for me to just reinstall Windows and start again. I guess six years on a Windows machine without reinstalling is a good record.
