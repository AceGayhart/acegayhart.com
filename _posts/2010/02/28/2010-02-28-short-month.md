I know that February is a short month. However, it seemed to go quicker than usual. As typical, we had a bunch of snow. Once weekend, the snow almost prevented us from leaving the house. I am still hoping for a true snow day. About a year ago, they closed the College for a day. Of course, they closed it at 4:00 PM, so that was a virtual waste of a snow day.
