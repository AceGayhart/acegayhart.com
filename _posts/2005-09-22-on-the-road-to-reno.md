After another restful night in our hotel and a filling breakfast from the local cafe, Rachel and I packed up our belongings and prepared to travel again. We stopped back by mom and step dad's house for a quick chat. Then, we filled up at a gas station, picked up some DVDs at the local Best Buy, and made our way to Reno, NV.

Around lunchtime, we stopped in Rocklin, CA at a Jack In The Box. Ever since we moved to Ohio, I have missed their food. For the longest time, I have been bugging Rachel about how I wanted some "Bacon Cheddar Potato Wedges". Finally, I fulfilled my craving (and then some).

A few hours later and we pulled into the parking garage at the Silver Legacy. We did not know it at the time, but apparently today was the start of "Street Vibrations," a five-day motorcycle festival. Our first clue was the two parking garage levels that were packed with several hundred motorcycles. Our next clue was the reservations overflowing with leather-clad individuals. Fortunately, as we already had confirmed reservations, we only needed to check in. Rachel found a spot to sit with our luggage, while I waited a half hour in line.

When I was checking in, there were some issues with my credit card. I was not sure if there were too many charges from the past few days or if I was over my limit. In either case, I gave the hotel clerk a different credit card. A few minutes later with card keys in hand, we made our way to our room.

The Silver Legacy has some fast elevators. It took mere seconds to ride to the twenty-ninth floor. I do not know what it is, but it seems that our rooms are usually the farthest distance from the elevator. We got lucky this time; our room was very close.

We had quite a shock when we entered the room. When I placed the reservations, I ordered a room with a hot tub. I knew that it was going to be slightly bigger than the normal rooms, but I was not expecting it to be as big as it was. When we first entered the room, we passed a closet area on the left and the bathroom door on the right. Next came a queen size bed. On the wall was a giant flat screen television. There was also a small living room area with a couch, table, and chairs. Next to the couch was a large Jacuzzi with a perfect view of television. Of course, with such a big television, you could be anywhere in the room and still see it. Out the windows, just past the couch, was a lovely view of the city and the hotel's pool.

We had another shock when we entered the bathroom. The room had double sinks. The toilet had its own nook complete with a phone and shelf. The shower was its own room; it must have been at least seven feet by seven feet. On one of the walls, there was a bench, so you could take a shower while seated. Heck, it was big enough for me to lie down.

After getting situated, running downstairs to get the internet access turned on, and waiting for Rachel to finish her nap, I called my dad Jimmy and step mom Norma. They came over to the hotel to visit for a while. Since the Silver Legacy does not allow people to go into the elevators without a room key, I had to take the quick ride down to let them in. After talking for a while, the four of us headed to the Victorian Buffet (which is inside the hotel).

I had forgotten how much food the Buffet had. I made several trips through the line, each time getting something different. However, I did not even come close to trying everything on the menu. Maybe I will be able to try again tomorrow.

After a filling dinner and dessert (read stuffed), we started making our way back to the room. Outside of the buffet, you could get your picture taken with a motorcycle and two "biker chicks." At Norma's insistence, Jimmy and I got our pictures taken together.

Rachel and I said our goodbyes and headed back to the room. We sat in the Jacuzzi while we watched television. It was extremely relaxing.
