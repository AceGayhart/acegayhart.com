It's been over a month since our two new additions. We had been treating Kelly for tapeworm, but she is now clean. Also, both Kara and Kelly have gained some weight since their last vet appointment. Kara is now 16.6 lbs (she was 12.6) and Kelly is now 18.0 lbs (she was 16.4 lbs).

We're still working on their potty training. Now accidents are a few days apart instead of a few hours. I think they are finally adjusting to their feeding schedule. We feed them twice a day at 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM. If we're a minute late, they start barking.

Now that things are settling down, we decided to start some training. They know OUTSIDE well. They're pretty good with OFF, FOOD and CRATE. I'm currently teaching them how to sit. Kelly's catching on fairly quickly, but Kara's not too far behind.

A while ago, we took them for their first walk (just around the block). We got a leash splitter so I could take both Kara and Kelly on a single leash. It took them (and me) about half a block to get used to it. But, by the time we got home, they were doing just fine.

Tagline for today: "My dental hygienist is cute. Every time I visit, I eat a whole package of Oreo cookies while waiting in the lobby. Sometimes she has to cancel the rest of the afternoon's appointments." - Steven Wright
