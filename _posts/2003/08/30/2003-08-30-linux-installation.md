Finally, after spending a day or so trying to get the installation discs downloaded, I am ready to install. Since this is my first Linux installation, I decided to use Red Hat's version. I figured that since Red Hat is apparently fairly well known I should not have too much problem getting support.

I like how the installation looks. It has a very simple and clean interface. I can't wait until the installation is finished so that I can start using it! I may have fudged a bit on the install (I choose to install *everything*). But, I figure that I can always just re-install and start again if I need to.
