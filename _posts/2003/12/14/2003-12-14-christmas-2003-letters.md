This week we got our Christmas letters out in the mail. If you don't receive a letter within the next few weeks (and would like to receive a letter), just send an email with your mailing address. I also decided to post the picture (that we sent out with the letters). We had wanted to get our picture taken with Santa, but unfortunately our work schedules wouldn't allow it. However, I think the picture turned out just fine. After sealing the letters, we had the idea to put a decorative border around the picture. So, the posted picture is only slightly different from the one we sent out. From left to right, that's Rachel (my wife), Emily (our dog) and me.

Tagline for today: "I bought my brother some gift-wrap for Christmas. I took it to the Gift Wrap department and told them to wrap it, but in a different print so he would know when to stop unwrapping." - Steven Wright
