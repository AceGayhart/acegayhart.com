I was trying to print out some letters yesterday on my printer (I have an Epson Stylus C80) and I was having some problems. After printing about a dozen letters, I noticed that I started to get some gaps in the printout. Tried to run the ink head cleaning utility, but I didn't have much luck. I kept getting a message a being low on yellow ink. So, I skipped the cleaning for a bit. However, it wouldn't let me print anything any more. The printer has a black ink cartridge in addition to the color ones. It was frustrating to not be able to print a black and white document simply because I didn't have any yellow ink.

The next day, I put in a new yellow cartridge and tried the cleaning again. I got a bit farther, but then I started getting messages that I was now out of magenta. I replaced the magenta cartridge and tried cleaning again. I got a lot farther this time, but then the printer told me that I was out of cyan. Fortunately, I had the foresight to purchase all three colors.

After getting the cyan cartridge change and the print heads cleaned, I was once again able to print. It's times like these that I miss my old black and white daisy-wheel printer.
