Since my wife and I were both unable to take time off this week (due to the Thanksgiving holiday), we decided to take vacation time last week to celebrate our two-year anniversary (today). We were planning to go out to dinner and watch some movies. Unfortunately, things didn't turn out quite the way we wanted to. However, we still had a fairly good week:

My wife woke up with cold and flu symptoms on Tuesday. Consequently, she spent most of the rest of the week in bed. I wasn't much better. I had a sore back (I think I slept on it wrong) on Wednesday and Thursday. So, I spent a lot of time in bed with a heating pad.

We did get a chance to watch some movies. Thanks to DirecTV's Pay Per View, we watched Phone Booth, The Italian Job, Shanghai Knights and Anger Management. I think that The Italian Job was the best movie out of the bunch. Thanks to East Of Chicago Pizza, we were able to have a nice (and rather filling) dinner. Now that we're both feeling better we are planning to go out to dinner some time soon.
