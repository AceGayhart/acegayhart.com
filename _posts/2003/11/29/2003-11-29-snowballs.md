After watching the rain all day Thursday, it was kind of nice that the weather changed to something else on Friday. As you can see from the picture, we got just enough snow to coat the ground. I think that we got less than a quarter of an inch because parts of the grass were still visible. It was enough, however, to make a few nice big snowballs. Unfortunately, since no one else was outside at 10:30 at night, I didn't have any one to throw my snowballs at. My wife was wise enough to stay inside. The trees in our backyard weren't quite as lucky. In other parts of the city enough snow was on the ground that snow plows were needed. The only problem we had was that our satellite reception went out (until I cleared off the dish). If the snow gets worse, I may have to buy a snow cover or get a heated dish. But for now, I'll just wait and see.
