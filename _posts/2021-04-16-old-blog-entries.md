I was finally able to migrate my old blog entries.  Well, as much as I cared to.  I pulled much of my blog from archive.org.  But, it didn't archive all the posts.  For some of the posts, I only have the excerpt.  I also don't have the pictures.

I'm positive that I have archives of my site.  But, considering some may be on Zip disks, it's likely not worth the effort.  As mentioned, I scraped content from archive.org.  Since the layout and formatting of my site changed multiple times since 2003, it became a bit tedious to pull out a single post and apply new formatting.

To reduce the tedium, I wrote a small program to parse what I scraped.  It then wrote out a markdown file for each post.  I still had to do some hand formatting here and there.  I'll also need to apply categories and tags.  But, this was far simpler than manually editing each post.

This means I can cross a few things off my list:

- [ ] Styling / theming
- [X] Migration of old posts
- [X] Date formatting
- [X] Pagination
- [X] About page
- [ ] Coding block styling
- [X] Navigation

I'm working on creating a new theme as I am not quite happy with the current colors.  More specifically, I want a better set of light and dark themes.  Also, I'm thinking about reformatting pages with multiple posts to display as cards.

While sharing some posts on LinkedIn, I noticed that the formatting could be better.  In particular, I'm missing an Open Graph tag for pictures.

So, we're adding a few more things to the list:

- [ ] Light / Dark themes
- [ ] Post excerpts as cards
- [ ] Open Graph tags for sharing
