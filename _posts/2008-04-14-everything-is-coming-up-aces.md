I finished my two classes, "Introduction to Web Design" and "Networking Concepts," last week. Today, I received my official grade report. As typical for technical/computer classes, I aced both classes. I received a 100% in the former class while only receiving a 98.64% in the latter.

Now, I have a few days off before I start my next two classes: "Database Management" and "Advanced Visual Basic." I am really enjoying my classes so far. However, I want to take an additional class each term. While it will be more work, I will earn my degree quicker.
