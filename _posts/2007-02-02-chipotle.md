Rachel and I went to Chipotle (or as we like to say, "chip-poodle") for the first time. It is kind of like a fast food restaurant in that you stand in line to order your food. Imagine if Subway was a Mexican restaurant. I would have preferred a sit-down place (you can dine in), but it was nice and interesting to watch the food being made. At any rate, the food was tasty and filling. I think I need a nap.
