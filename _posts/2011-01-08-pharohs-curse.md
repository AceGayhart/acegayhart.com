After nearly a quarter century, I have beat Pharaoh's Curse! But, I am getting ahead of myself.

[This excerpt was all that was recovered from archive.  Pharaoh's Curse was a game I enjoyed in my youth on a Commodore-64.  But, since the game was stored on a cassette tape, it would take *forever* to load and would often not load on the first attempt.  Occassionally, the game would complete its loading in the midst of a family meal blaring the intro sounds throughout the house.  My parents would tell me to turn off the game.  I never learned to mute the TV while the game was loading.  It wasn't until several years later that I remembered the name of the game, found it on an emulator, *and* beat it.--*Ed*.]
