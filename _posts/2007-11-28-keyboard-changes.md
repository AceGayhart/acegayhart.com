As a software developer, I spend an inordinate amount of time pounding away at my keyboard. Recently, my wrists have started to bug me while at work. Several years ago, I got a couple of natural keyboards. I finally brought one into work. It should help to alleviate my pain as well as increase my typing efficiency.
