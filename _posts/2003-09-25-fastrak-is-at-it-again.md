Awhile ago, I got my fourth FasTrak violation. The violations, of course, were not my fault. Apparently FasTrak didn't like my explanation for the fourth violation (or more likely, they never received my letter). Anyway, the $2.00 toll would now cost me $27.00 (if it was my fault). So, $2.00 for the toll, $5.00 for a toll evasion fee and $20.00 for a late fee. I don't know about you, but having a late fee that is nearly three times the cost as the rest of the bill is just ridiculous. Fortunately, I don't have to pay this. But, I almost feel sorry for the real perpetrator. :)
