Yesterday, we took down our inflatable turkey and put up our inflatable Christmas Tiggers. They did not last long. Sometime between midnight and 6:00 this morning, someone stole them. We, of course, called the police. But, there probably is not much that they can do.

Tagline for today: "When I first heard that Marge was joining the police academy, I thought it would be fun and zany, like that movie 'Spaceballs'. But instead it was dark and disturbing, like that movie 'Police Academy'." - Homer Simpson
