[Since 2009](/2009/01/15/new-job/), I have worked at [Cuyahoga Community College](https://www.tri-c.edu/) (Tri-C).  In 2021, I decided that it was [time for a change](/2021/07/30/time-for-a-change/) and decided to leave Tri-C.  While my full-time position ended on July 30, 2021, my part-time assignment continued through the Fall 2021 semester.  

Recently, I've been focusing on my finances.  In particular, I have been more focused on a retirement fund.  No, I'm not looking to retire soon.  But, the sooner one plans for retirement, the better it ends up being.

After talking with a financial advisor, we decided it was best to transfer funds from [OPERS](https://www.opers.org/) and [STRS Ohio](https://www.strsoh.org/).  The intention was that it would be easier to manage.  Additionally, I wouldn't be penalized with inactivity fees.

Partway through the process, I ran into an issue:  Even though I had officially resigned from my full-time position and had stopped teaching, I was still listed as an active employee.  I had to formally resign from that position as well.

This morning was the first time I couldn't log into Tri-C-related resources.  It was a bit sad to finally close this chapter in my life.  While it is sad to not be affiliated with the College, it is also a bit freeing to move forward.

Perhaps I may return to Tri-C either as an instructor or a student.  But, for now, I'm happy to explore my new path.
