After living in this house for over two decades, it is way past time for some much-needed improvements.  This past summer, we were able to get a new roof.  Just this week, we got new windows and doors.

I didn't expect it, but much more light is coming into the house.  Indeed, the windows are now the cleanest they ever could be.  But, the window screens have a thinner mesh.  Unless I'm up close, it is difficult to tell where the screens are.

I also didn't expect how much adding a window to the front door would brighten up the house's exterior and the living room.  Of course, newer materials and technologies also mean less heat loss.  I appreciate having a much warmer and more energy-efficient house, especially as we move into the winter months.
