Well, I logged on to check to see how my Linux download was doing. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I tried downloading it again, but it said the server had too many connections. *sigh* I'm trying from a different server. Hopefully this one won't drop me. Or, if it does, maybe it will let me resume my transfer instead of restarting it.

In other news, I see that PayPal is back online. No reason why it shut down. It seem to be very. Of course, that could be because I'm downloading Linux in the background.

Well, I guess that it for me tonight.
