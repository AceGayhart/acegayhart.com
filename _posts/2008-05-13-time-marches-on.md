This past week has been relatively quiet. So far, my schoolwork has been easy; I do more complex stuff at work. Rachel and I recently finished The Simpsons Game on the Wii. I am still working on Super Paper Mario when Rachel is not home.

This morning, I felt like I was forgetting something. Aside from my shoelace ripping through my shoe, the morning was typical. It was not until I was halfway into my commute that I realized it was birthday. I am not expecting to do anything or receive anything special. My wife and I already agreed that getting the Wii should suffice.

When I got to work, I had several automated e-mails from various websites I frequent wishing me a happy birthday. I wish that I could have a less automated response. I did receive a text message from my younger sister. I had not heard from her in about a year. While short and impersonal, at least she remembered. Of course, seeing how we share the same birthday, I am not surprised.
