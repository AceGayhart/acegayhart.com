During a routine checkup, our veterinarian noticed that Kara's teeth needed cleaning. As all three dogs have the same routine, we are not quite sure why her teeth were significantly worse than the other two dogs. At any rate, we had the vet do a full cleaning.

Rachel dropped off Kara at the vet on Monday and picked her up yesterday afternoon. Kara seemed a bit lethargic at first (understandably considering the anesthesia and drugs she was given). But, she seems back to normal. It will take a few days before she is back to her normal routine.

I was reading her "after surgery" care instructions. It gave recommendations for food, water, and such. I did think it funny that we are supposed to prevent her from licking her wounds. Um yeah, how exactly would we prevent her from licking her teeth?
