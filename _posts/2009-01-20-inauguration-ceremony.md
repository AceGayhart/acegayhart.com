Rachel and I went to the Lorain Palace Theatre to watch Barak Obama's Presidential Inauguration Ceremony. I am not really a political person. However, I had never been to that theater. In addition, it is a historical event. There were a number of news crews there. One of them even caught a picture of us standing there.
