It is difficult to believe that another month has already passed. Fortunately, we did not experience too many problems. As usual, we had our ups and down. But, it averaged out in the end. For example, we received a nice federal refund this year. That was quickly spent on repairs to the truck.

I am still waiting for my degree. If I can get a student loan or scholarship for about $7,200, I will be able to get my degree. It is so frustrating to be unable to receive my degree due to a lack of money. It is equally frustrating not to be able to start a new degree.
