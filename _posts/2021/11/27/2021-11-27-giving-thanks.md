With Thanksgiving this week, it is an appropriate time to give thanks.  First, I'm thankful for my wife.  This week we celebrated our twentieth anniversary.  With the ongoing pandemic, we felt that our celebration options were a bit limited.  

Rather than going out to eat, we decided to rent out a theater.  We saw "Ron's Gone Wrong" last Saturday and "Ghostbusters: Afterlife" on Thanksgiving.  It was a bit weird being in a nearly empty movie theater.  But, it was nice getting out of the house and pushing aside our worries for a bit.

Second, I'm thankful for my new job.  While it will still take a few months before I feel confident and effective in my position, I am grateful for stable employment.  While I like my new team, I'm glad that I don't physically need to be in an office.

Lastly, I'm thankful for a good meal.  Yes, Thanksgiving tends to be the time when people eat beyond their heart's content.  But, I'm grateful that we are currently in a position to not worry about food.

I hope that everyone had a happy and safe Thanksgiving!
