With the pandemic, more people are working remotely.  This leads to more conversations via technology instead of in-person discussions.  While I've gotten more emails than usual, there has been a noticeable increase in instant messages (IM).  With more IMs, I've received some insight into the way some people like communicating.

Sometimes, I get an IM with no preamble, punctuation, capitalization, or context.  For example:

> what's the xyz project

These types of messages come from someone in a hurry.  I'm okay with the lack of punctuation and capitalization here.  I would appreciate a "Hi!" or some sort of greeting as part of the IM.  But, what I'm missing is the content.  Why are you asking?  Are you looking for a quick summary of the project's history?  Do you have questions about the implementation?  Are you having an issue?

Instead, be more specific with your request:

> Hi Ace!  Joe is having issues logging in to XYZ.  Where should he go for support?

Now, I have everything I need to get a complete response.  Not only can I answer the request, but I may be able to provide additional help:

> Hey Paul!  It looks like Joe's password has expired.  He can go to *U*RL to reset his password.  Also, he can contact Steph with XYZ-specific issues.

Being more succinct upfront can make the communication more efficient.

After a bit of searching on text-messaging etiquette, I found "[No Hello](https://www.nohello.com/)" and [a few](https://nohello.net/) [variants](https://nohello.club/).  It's not actually about skipping the greetings in text messages.  But, instead, including greetings as part of your text.  Personally, that little greeting gives my brain a bit of time to pause and shift gears.

As an aside, I cannot help but think of Lionel Richie while writing this. üòÅ
