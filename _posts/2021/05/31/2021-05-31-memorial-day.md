Happy Memorial Day!  I am thankful for those who have served in the military to protect our freedoms.  I'm particularly grateful for my dad, who happens to also be celebrating a birthday today.

Today, my wife and I went to [Schoepfle Garden](https://www.loraincountymetroparks.com/schoepfle-garden).  Schoepfle is pronounced like "chef lee."  But we like calling it Shipoopi.  Oblig. Family Guy reference:

Last time, we took the free tram through the gardens.  Then, we walked around through the gardens.  Today, we took a 2.38-mile hike around the outside of the gardens.  While not quite as colorful as the gardens, it was a nice, quiet walk.  

In no particular order, here are some pictures I took:
