Just over two years ago, I brought a jade plant into work.  When we made the shift to remote work, my boss took over the watering duties.  Once it became apparent that we'd be out for several months, I came into the office to retrieve all my plants.

Not all of the plants survived the move or thrived in their new location.  But, my jade plant is doing well.  Currently, it is the only plant in my home office.  I heard that one could take its leaves and start new plants.  Several weeks ago, that is just what I did.

It took longer than I expected, but when I gently tug on the leaves, I can feel that they've rooted.  One of the leaves appears as if it is dying.  But, upon closer inspection, we can see new sprouts.  While I don't know how it will fair, I'm interested in the plant it will become.

I'm in a similar situation with my career.  After a month or so of applying to new jobs and interviews, I'm happy to report that I can now stop that process.  Yesterday, I signed an official offer letter, and I look forward to starting the next chapter of my career.  (I plan to share more once I'm past my official start date.)

While it feels good to know that I have secured a new position, starting a new job feels weird.  I have a good understanding of the job description and have met fantastic members of the team.  But, it will probably take a few months before I have completely acclimated to a new position.  Similarly, my seedlings will take several months before they feel stable.

While I patiently (impatiently?) wait to start moving forward, it is nice to reflect on where I've been and the people who have helped me along the way.  It is also awe-inspiring to see the journey I'm about to take.
