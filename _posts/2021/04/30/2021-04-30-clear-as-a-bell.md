This morning, I attended a [free, monthly webinar](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/reboot-your-leadership-impact-re-assess-re-awaken-re-affirm-tickets-137423895571)
hosted by [Ratliff & Taylor](https://www.ratliffandtaylor.com/).  They provide services such as career transition and executive searches.  I first ran across them in 2014 when I started the Mandel Foundation Leadership Development Program.

This morning's focus was on leadership development.  If I had one takeaway, it is that words matter.  In particular, as leaders, the words we use are critical.

For me, what I found is that I am exceedingly clear in my vision.  When I ask my team to work on a new project, I know precisely how the project should look.  But, after an of instruction and conversation, what I realized is that I am not being explicit in my instruction.

I suspect many of us have this issue: we know what we want, but we don't clearly articulate it to those around us.  For me, this leads to a disparity between vision and execution.  It also means that I need to do better in making sure my team and I are on the same page.

A challenge that I foresee is explaining the end vision without dictating the steps to get there.  I don't want to add clarity while simultaneously adding micromanagement.  A related issue is limiting myself to a particular vision.  Maybe there is an even better outcome.

Another realization I had is that I am hedging in my language.  I haven't decided yet why.  Perhaps it is a lack of confidence.  Or, maybe, I don't want to offend others by being direct in my request.

Regardless, the webinar provided me with some things on which to contemplate.
