Rachel found some pizza in our back yard. Apparently, the people who live behind us were throwing pizza over into our yard. Our dogs, of course, find the food, eat it, and get sick. I have been tempted to throw the waste back over the fence.

As I am quite a bit short on cash, I did not have enough money to buy gas. I ended up having to use gas from the gas can we use for our lawn mower. I was not sure if it would be enough. My vehicle has a "distance to empty" (DTE) display that shows the number of miles before you run out of gas (with a little buffer). I knew that as long as it exceeded 50 miles, I would be okay to make it to work. I sat in my vehicle for a few minutes watching the DTE slowly count up. Once it crossed 60, I knew I would have enough.
