Hi. The Linux install went rather smoothly. The only problem was that I had was a lack of a network connection. I didn't have a cable long enough to reach from my hub to the laptop. So, if anyone would like to buy me a wireless router and/or a wireless network card, I'd greatly appreciate it. :)

Anyway, I spend a most of the first few hours watching screens savers and testing out all of the games. :) I think that the games would probably been better had I not been using a laptop. Or, if I was at least using a full-sized keyboard and mouse. But overall I enjoyed the experience. If it wasn't for the fact that I have to do most of my work (programming) on a Windows platform, I'd consider switching one of my desktops to Linux. In the meantime, I'll keep playing around with it on my laptop. Now, if only I could find that documentation disk....
