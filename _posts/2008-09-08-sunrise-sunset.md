Rachel and I wanted to get out of the house for a while. The only problem is that we do not have a lot of money. Therefore, any overnight trip is out of the question as it is expensive to board our three dogs. Of course, even if did not have to board the dogs, most trips would be too expensive.

Since we were both off on Saturday, we thought that it would be fun to watch the sunrise at Lakeview Park (in Lorain, OH). But, the light rain that came down on Friday night did not give us much hope for good weather the next day. Sure enough, it was raining when we got up in the morning. We were a bit disappointed, but enjoyed the extra sleep when we were able to go back to bed.

Our fall back plan was to watch the sunset. As it turns out, it was a good plan. We spent a bit of time looking at the next signs and structures at the park. Then, we walked all of the rings of the rose garden. Finally, we walked down to the beach. We walked along the edge until we found a nice quiet spot to sit and wait for the sunset.

As expected, the sunset was quite beautiful. The whole experience only took a few hours out of our day. But, we both enjoyed it and are looking forward to doing it again soon.
