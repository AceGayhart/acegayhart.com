After downloading a copy of Oracle 9i Lite, I decided to burn it to a CD. I didn't feel like waiting through another hour-long download if I could help it. So, I put in a blank CD-R into the burner. Linux recognized it immediately. While the interface isn't very "flashy", it is simple, quick and it works! Very cool. Hopefully the Oracle install will be just as easy. Okay, so it'll probably be a bit more complicated. But, I can always hope. :)
