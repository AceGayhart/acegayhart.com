I am still enjoying work. I keep thinking, "I can't believe that they are paying me for having fun." It is good to have a job that you enjoy. At any rate, I think that most of my coworkers like having me working there as they have given me the nickname "Code Monkey." Now, the phrase is a bit derogatory, but it is all in good fun. I still prefer being called "Ace," but I like the Code Monkey song.

Tagline for today: "Apu, you got any Skittle Brau? Never mind, just give me some Duff and a pack of Skittles." - Homer Simpson
