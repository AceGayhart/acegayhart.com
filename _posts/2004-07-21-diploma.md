Well after working for four years I'm finally finished with my two-year degree. My diploma and final transcript came in the mail yesterday. I'm glad that it's over. I am, however, a bit annoyed with myself for taking so long. I think part of my problem was a lack of motivation to complete the non-fun classes. While taking classes via correspondence had its benefits, it also had its problems; I could take as long (or as short) as I wanted for each class. With Saint Leo, I'll be on a set schedule. I imagine that will help tremendously.
