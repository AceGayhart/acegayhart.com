Since this week is National Dog Week, I've decided to post a picture of my puppy dog. Her name is "Emily Jean". though we usually call her "Emmy". As I've mentioned before, she's a Beagle/Spring mix. She will be three years old on September 24th, 2003.

We got Emmy at the end of last year, shortly after my other dog, Sir Chip-A-Lot (Chipper), died. It is interesting that Chipper was a English Springer Spaniel and my wife's former dog, Gopher, was a Beagle. I'm glad that we got the best of both worlds with Emmy.
