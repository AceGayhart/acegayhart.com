I don't know if anyone of you watches systm. Anyway, on the last half of Episode #10, they showed an LED panel that reflects the number of Diggs a particular website has received. My program was lucky enough to be chosen as the LED controller. For more information, go to the Digg the Digg Button website. If you any questions about my software or need help with other software, let me know.
