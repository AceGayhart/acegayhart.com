I just finished putting up a new photo gallery. I still have a bit of tweaking to do. But, it is done for the most part. The new gallery can handle more pictures and has a better slideshow feature. In addition, people can create user accounts. Registered users will be able to view larger, higher quality pictures, rate the pictures, and add comments. Registered users will also be able to have their pictures printed by a printing company.

This Sunday we took the dogs to get their heartworm test. The vet's office was having a testing drive, so the place was packed. The vet was so rushed that he accidentally poked himself with one of the (clean) needles. He said that it was not the first time it happened. The receptionist was busy too. She charged us $1.24 instead of $124.00. I noticed the error when we got home and was nice enough to inform them of their mistake.

On Sunday, we also visited Cold Stone Creamery for the second time. The last time the place had too many people and we did not want to wait. This time they had fewer people. Rachel got a banana mix while I got a cookie dough concoction. They were extremely yummy.

On Monday, we went to Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery. When my father-in-law, Kenny, passed away last May, he did not get the military burial that he was entitled to. Exactly a year later, and we were able to properly lay him to rest. Of course, this does not mean that the ceremony did not have its problems. There was some confusion between the funeral director and us. He thought that we wanted Kenny interred into a memorial wall (the Columbarium). After talking with the administration, we were able to put him in the ground.

A few days ago, I started having problems with my laptop's mouse. The left mouse button would work on an intermittent basis. Sometimes the clicks would register. Sometimes, it would only register that the button had been pressed or unpressed. Needless to say, this was very annoying. After receiving a replacement part, it only took the removal of two-dozen screws to remove the old part. But, at least I can left-click again.

Tagline for today: "The problem with the designated driver program, it's not a desirable job. But if you ever get sucked into doing it, have fun with it. At the end of the night, drop them off at the wrong house." - Jeff Foxworthy
