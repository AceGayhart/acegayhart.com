After waiting more than two weeks, I finally got the results on my final exam. I passed. I got 100% on all of the exams except for one (I only got a 90% on that one). I haven't gotten my exams back yet, so I'm not sure which questions I missed. But, it relieves some of the stress knowing that I passed. Now, I need to focus on my final project.
