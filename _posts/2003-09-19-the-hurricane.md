Well, we've been getting a lot of rain due to Tropical Storm Isabel. The funny thing is that we're getting more rain now then when a flood watch was declared in my area. I love the rain. Fortunately for us, the only damage that we've had is to our Strawberry Popcorn plants. Ah well. I guess we'll have to try to grow them again next year.
