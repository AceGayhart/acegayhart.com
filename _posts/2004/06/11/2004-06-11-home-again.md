We brought home the dogs from being boarded yesterday. The person at the front desk said that they were good, for the most part. Apparently Kara and Kelly managed to crawl underneath the barrier separating them and another dog. The person had said that's the first time that has ever happened and they're still trying to figure out how the dogs got through. Anyway, the dogs were very happy to come home. They were smiling the entire trip. They must have enjoyed their "therapeutic baths" that they received during their stay.

Tagline for today: "Did you ever hear one of these corny, positive messages on someone's answering machine? 'Hi, it's a great day and I'm out enjoying it right now. I hope you are too. The thought for the day is Share the love. Beep.' 'Uh, yeah... this is the VD clinic calling.... Speaking of being positive, your test is back. Stop sharing the love.'" - Andy Rooney
