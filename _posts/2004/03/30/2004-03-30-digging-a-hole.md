My father-in-law and I spent the weekend on a new gate. We spent Saturday measuring, buying supplies and digging holes. Well, we tried to dig holes anyway. Unfortunately, the concrete and the fill underneath the concrete were too much for our crowbars and shovels. On Sunday, we rented an electric jackhammer. That was my first time using one. It was actually kind of fun. It does take quite a lot out of you though. On Monday, I put the gate up temporarily. We still have some concrete work to do. We want to build a small ramp that goes between the back porch and the driveway.

I put up a temporary fence so the dogs can't go behind the garage. This way, we can stand on the back porch and see them at all times. I was getting tired of going behind the garage to check on them. Also, they were trying to squeeze through a small hole in the corner of the fence. Lately, we had been tethering the dogs when they went outside. But now they can run free. They were pretty ecstatic this afternoon. All three of the dogs were chasing each other. Now, we only have to watch them to make sure they don't dig under the fence.
