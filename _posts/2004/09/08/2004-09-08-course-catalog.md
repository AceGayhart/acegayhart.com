I was going through some online documents at Saint Leo. One of the documents that I found was the course catalog. Unfortunately, the document was over a hundred and seventy pages long making it a bit unwieldy to read online. I was thinking about printing it on my printer, but it would have probably taken days. I decided to have Kinko's print it for me. Since the closest Kinko's is not very close and since FedEx bought out Kinko's, I just uploaded the document for them to print it out and deliver it. The process was quicker than I had expected; I uploaded the document on Monday and received it today. They even put a cover on the document and bound it. I am very impressed.

Speaking of school, I have finished all of the homework that I can. Now, I just have to wait for the instructor to post the weekly discussion questions. I was a bit annoyed that we did not get this week's discussion question posted until today. However, considering that the school is located in Florida (in the midst of a hurricane), I am happy that she is doing okay.

I spent most of the morning as a chauffer for Rachel. We were able to get her doctor to fill out the proper BMV forms. In addition, we were able to get all of the forms to the BMV. If we are lucky, Rachel will be allowed to drive by the end of the week.

Tagline for today: "One time a cop pulled me over for running a stop sign. He said 'Didn't you see the stop sign?' I said 'Yeah, but I don't believe everything I read.'" - Steven Wright
