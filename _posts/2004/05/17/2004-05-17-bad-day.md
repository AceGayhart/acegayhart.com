Well, my day had been going good. Unfortunately, that's no longer the case. The hard drive on my home computer died on me. Most of what I lost isn't a big deal. However, I did lose all my digital pictures. I have some of my wedding pictures backed up to CD, so I didn't lose everything. If I had an extra thousand dollars to spend, I could send it to a drive recovery place. Ah well. Now, if only I could afford a backup device.... At least the drive is under warranty. So, I should get a new drive in a few days.

I had thought that losing my hard drive would have been bad enough. But, it got a bit worse. I had noticed that one of my dogs, Kelly, had been scratching her ear a lot. I took a look to see what was wrong, but I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. As a precaution, I checked the other dogs. I found a tick in Emily's ear. Fortunately, the tick didn't get in very far. It looks like the entire tick came out. However, we'll keep the tick and take it to the veterinarian.

It's only Monday. I sure hope the rest of the week isn't this bad.

Tagline for today: I haven't lost my mind; it's backed up on tape somewhere!
