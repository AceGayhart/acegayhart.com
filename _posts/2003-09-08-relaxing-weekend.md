Ugh. It's Monday, again! Ah well. I had a pretty good weekend. I don't think I accomplished anything in particular though. I did get to eat at Mr. Hero. I hadn't eaten there in quite awhile. I also went to Stake n Shake. But no, I didn't spend the whole weekend eating. *L* I also watched some movies and caught up on my sleep. I think I got about ten more hours of sleep than I normally do on a weekend.

Unfortunately, I didn't get anything done on my "to-do" list. But, I needed the break and I'm glad that I took it.
