Rachel and I decided to enroll Kelly and Kara in an eight-week basic training course at PETsMART. They're slowly learning with us. But it would probably be more beneficial for them (and us) to have structured training. Our first class was last Monday. Since we didn't have the dogs with us (it was just an orientation) the class went by quickly. I'm excited (and anxious) to bring them to class next week. They gave us a training guide to study. Also, I've been reading The Complete Idiot's Guide To Beagles (among other things).

Speaking of reading, I've redesigned my site to show the books that I'm reading along with a link to buy them. Now that I've got a bit more spare time, I've decided to take up reading again. I hope to go through at least one new book a month.

When I was on vacation, Rachel and I ate at Eat 'n Park. It was the first time that we'd ever been there. We weren't too happy with our experience: I couldn't have a baked potato and the salad bar was closed. Rachel wasn't allowed to make substitutions (the manager later allowed it). When we got our meal, my dressing was served on my arm. I've had worse though. One time, I had a diet coke served down the front of my shirt and in my lap. Anyway, I sent Eat 'n Park a complaint e-mail. I was surprised at the quick e-mail response. I was also surprised to receive a letter with two five-dollar gift certificates a few days later. So, maybe we'll try them again. Unfortunately, the closest one to us is about twenty-five miles away in Parma. Fortunately the gift certificates don't have an expiration date.

While we were driving on our vacation, we made a list of the different state license plates that we found. Here's our list: Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Tagline for today: "When I was 8, I played little league. I was on first; I stole third; I went straight across. Earlier that week, I learned that the shortest distance between two points was a direct line. I took advantage of that knowledge." - Steven Wright
