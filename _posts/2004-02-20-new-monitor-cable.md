I can see! I can see! For a few months, the color on my monitor kept changing. Some days the white would be blue, red or yellow. Sometimes, it would keep changing. It was getting very annoying not to mention being hard on my eyes. I bought a replacement cable from Best Buy. Unfortunately, the cable they sold wasn't much better. The color was okay, but I kept getting ghost images. That was just as annoying as the changing color. Eventually, I broke down and ordered a high-end cable from Black Box. And boy, what an improvement! White actually looks like white again. :-)
