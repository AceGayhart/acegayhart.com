Today has been extremely windy. This morning the wind blew a picture off of our staircase and ended up shattering a drinking glass. We had hoped that was extent of the damage, but as you can see in the picture, it wasn't. Around noon, we heard a dull thump outside. We had thought that it was just a trashcan being blown around or something. When I went outside to investigate I saw a large limb laying across our entire backyard. The limb was probably three or four inches thick at its thickest point. Fortunately there was no damage. Amazingly, the branch landed a few inches from the fence on one side of the yard and the garage on the other side of the yard.

In other news, I recently got two new desks for my home office. The card tables that I was using were okay, but they weren't very stable. Besides, I needed something a bit more permanent. While I was cleaning and rearranging I ran across my old computer. This was the computer that I used to run my BBS from. It had a 250-megabyte hard drive and a 5-gigabyte hard drive. I was still amazed that it even turned on, let alone booted without many problems. Heck, the smaller hard drive had to be at least ten years old.

Anyway, since the computer was outdated I decided to erase all the information and donate it somewhere. But, before I did, I recovered a few old photos from my web cam. The first photo is a picture of some dogs in my old bedroom. The big one in front is Sir Chip A Lot (Chip). He was a purebred English Spring Spaniel. Sadly, we had to put him to sleep in November 2002. The white one on the right is Rainbow. He's a poodle mix. The one on left is Rusty. He's a terrier mix. Both Rainbow and Rusty are still living with my parents.

That's meThe next two pictures are of me sitting in my old bedroom. The date on the pictures is August 4th, 1999. I must have been at the computer. I couldn't say what I was doing. Looking at the background, however, I could say that my room was a bit messy. This of course was a regular state for my room. They say that a cluttered desk is the sign of a clean mind. I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate, but that's my excuse.

The last three pictures are of me in the old office. I'm not sure when they were taken, but I'm guessing some time in 1999. By my facial hair, I'm guessing that the pictures were probably taken about a month apart from each other. In case you were wondering, the software running on the computer behind me is an old version of the billing system that worked on at US2. The newer version is much, much better looking.
