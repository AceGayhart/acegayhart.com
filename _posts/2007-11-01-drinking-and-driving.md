Today was a good day at work. One of our vendors bought lunch for a few of us. In addition, he asked us out to dinner. I typically refuse dinner requests. They are usually 15-20 minutes out of my way. In addition, dinners are usually held 2-3 hours after I normally leave for the day. I usually don't want to stick around at work just for a free dinner. And, I don't live close enough where I could go home for a bit.

But, as I had advance notice and as the restaurant was on my way home, I decided to go. The food was both good and filling. I even had a beer (hey, if someone else is paying). The only downside is that I did not get home until around 9:00 PM.
