I recently got a Tivo unit that supports DirecTV. I must say that this is a *must* have item. You can pause live TV, record two different channels while watching a pre-recorded show at the same time!

Even though I work at home, I don't get to watch TV during the day. So, it is nice to have Tivo record all of my favorite shows. It is much easier than having to use a VCR.
