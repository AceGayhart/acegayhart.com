After getting all of my Windows computers updated with the latest Windows service packs, I decided to update my copy of Office. I went to the Office Update site to download the latest patches. After spending a bit of time downloading the update, it asked me for disk 2 for Office. Unfortunately, I can only find disk 1 at the moment. Ugh

In other news, I've been configuring Samba on my Linux machine. I'm just having some networking fun. Next, I'm going to install a copy of Pervasive for Linux. I've got an application that already runs on Pervasive for Windows. I was curious to see how well it would run on Linux.
