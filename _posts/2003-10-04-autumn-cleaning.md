My wife and I spent most of today cleaning. We did the inside of the house, then we did some yard work. We ended up with about a dozen trash bags filled with leaves and other yard debris.

Also, I did some minor changes to my blog. Now, each blog entry has its own page (when you click the Permalink link). This will allow Google and other search engines to properly index my site.
