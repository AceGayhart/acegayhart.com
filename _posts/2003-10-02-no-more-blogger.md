I've decided to stop using blogger.com. I have nothing against blogger.com. However, I wanted to see what it would take to write my own blogging software. I feel that this would give me greater control of how stuff is published. For example, it will allow me to create and publish XML and HTML files simultaneously. This will give me the ability to create a single page for each blog entry that search engines can cache while still giving me the ability to syndicate my blog via RSS/XML.

It took me a few days to get over my cold from a few days ago. Also, it took me a day or so to write my blogging code. So, if you were wondering why there was a gap in my posts, wonder no more.
