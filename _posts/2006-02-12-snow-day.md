We have not had a lot of snow here lately. I was a little depressed because this is the first year that I am well prepared. Each winter season, I add a bit more to my winter weather wear collection. Fortunately, I was able to wear everything last week when I was clearing driveways.

It was weird when the snow started: The snow was hammering our driveway. Yet, the driveway stayed dry. Usually, the snow melts on impact making the entire driveway wet. Once enough snow has fallen (and the driveway is cold enough), the snow stops melting and starts to pile up. This time either the snow evaporated on contact, or the driveway sucked it all in. Of course, after a few inches of snow had fallen, the driveway could no longer keep up.

It took me about ten minutes to bundle up. I put on my wool socks, snow pants, boots, hood, jacket, and gloves. Even though I was outside for several hours, I was very warm. In fact, after shoveling my third driveway, I became too hot and had to take off my jacket.
