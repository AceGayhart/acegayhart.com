Rachel and I again had breakfast at the local cafe before I headed to the office. I spent four hours there working and talking with my coworkers. Around lunchtime, I said that I would treat the office to lunch if they would figure out a place to eat. After debating for about fifteen minutes, I made an executive decision and said that we would get food from Chevy's. I was in the mood for Tex-Mex and Chevy's had been a regular eating spot for all of us.

The decision on what to order was a lot quicker then deciding from where to order; everyone already knew what he or she wanted. Ten minutes later and we finally got Roy, one of my coworkers, to place the order. Another ten minutes later and we get a call from Roy saying that he had been in an accident. Fortunately, nobody was seriously injured.

When I finally got back to the hotel, I was worried that Rachel would be mad at me for leaving her alone for so long. But, she passed the time by taking a three-hour nap. That must be nice.

We took a quick trip to Radio Shack to pick up some parts for my nephew Cody's DVD player. Then, we headed to Fosters Freeze to get Rachel something to eat (and to get me some ice cream).

After relaxing in the hotel room for a while, Rachel and I made our way to Toys 'R Us. As a Tigger fan, Rachel had to scour the entire store to see if they had any Tiggers that she did not have. In addition, we picked up some books and toys for Cody and Briana.

Around dinnertime, we went back to Fred and Ellen's house. I played Frisbee with Cody and Briana for a while. Also, Rachel and I took a longer tour of the house and took some pictures. After a taco dinner, Rachel and I handed out presents to Cody and Briana. I fixed Cody's DVD player. Finally, I took several group pictures of everyone.

After a quick stop at Target to see more of Rachel's former coworkers, we went to Roy's house for a while. He gave us a tour as we talked for about a half hour. After having such a long day, Rachel and I were glad to be back at the hotel, especially now that internet access was finally working.
