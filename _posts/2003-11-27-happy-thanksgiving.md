My wife and I spent the afternoon at my father-in-law's parents' house for Thanksgiving. I spent some time helping to rewire their television setup. Afterwards, we had a nice and very filling dinner. Of course, I had to indulge in some pumpkin pie as well. On the down side, I'll probably have to exercise a bit more than usual for the next few days. On the up side, I probably won't need to eat for the next few days.
