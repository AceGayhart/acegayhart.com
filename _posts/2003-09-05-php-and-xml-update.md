Well, my blog now stores all of the information as XML files and then uses PHP to render the file. Again, there wasn't a need to switch from HTML to PHP & XML except as a learning experience. Of course, now that my blog uses XML, other sites could potentially retrieve the information easier.

On a side note, I added a search function for my blog. It's got a few bugs in it. But, for the most part it works just fine.
