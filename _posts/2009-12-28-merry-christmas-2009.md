I hope that everyone had a good Christmas. They say that this is the time of year we get together with friends and family. However, most of my friends out of state, getting together can be difficult.

Rachel and I went to her mother's house a few days before Christmas. Last night, we went to The Melting Pot. Aside from that, we have just stayed inside watching movies and playing video games. We upped our NetFlix subscription so we could watch a few more movies than usual. Once the winter break is over, I am going to drop it down to its usual level.

I was a bit disappointed that we did not have a white Christmas. Okay, there was a bit of snow on the ground before the rain melted it away. But, it is not the same. However, as it would not be much of a Northeast Ohio winter without some snow, the area's snow machine has recently turned on. Although it is unlikely, I am still hoping to get snowed in.

I recently finished my last two classes for the year. I will need to go back to school in a bit. But, I think I want to take a break. Rachel also finished (and aced) her first college class. She is already signed up to take another one in the spring.

I guess that is it for now. I just want a few more days of peace, quiet, and sleep before the year starts up again.
