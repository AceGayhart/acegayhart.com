So far, today has been a quiet day. I imagine that as it gets darker outside, it will become louder. Several of my neighbors have been setting off fireworks for the last few months. I enjoy fireworks as much as the next person does. However, I do not think that they have as much visual impact during the day as they would at night. Of course, I do not enjoy listening to the racket well past midnight. At least I do not have to work for a few days. Therefore, if the noise keeps me up tonight, I can sleep in tomorrow.

A few days ago, I started some new classes. I expected the algebra class to be the easiest. However, it has the biggest workload so far. Of course, most of my classes have few requirements for the first week. I will be able to make a better assessment next week.

Speaking of school, both the Golden Key International Honour Society and the Alpha Beta Kappa honor society have inducted me. The reason is that I have a 4.0. For similar reasons, I am on the president's list for the second time in a row.

Rachel and I went to see "Wanted" last night. It was an okay movie. I felt a bit too much like the title character, as I do not quite know who I am sometimes. This does not mean that I am going to become an assassin. Heck, if I had a gun, I would probably end up shooting myself.
