A few weeks ago, I received a ham from the HoneyBaked Ham Company. After removing as much meat as I could, I was still left with a rather large ham bone. Instead of tossing the bone, I decided to use it to make some bean stew. I started the stew last night, and I think it is about done. Of course, now I have the problem with an abundance of bean stew. I did use some of the excess ham stock and trimmings for the dogs' breakfast this morning. I think that might have been a mistake. The pushed all of the normal dog food out of the way (and on to the floor) so they could get to the good stuff. Fortunately, they cleaned up their own messes.

Last night, Rachel and I celebrated our fourth anniversary (which is actually tomorrow). In addition, since today is one of Rachel's aunt's birthday, we all had a celebratory dinner at our favorite restaurant last night.

This morning I had an interesting sleeping experience. Rachel had to go to work early. In addition, since the beans were still cooking, I wanted to get up and see how they were doing. Anyway, within a half-hour, I was getting back in bed for a few more hours of sleep. Normally, it takes between a half-hour and two hours before I fall asleep. However, I fell asleep almost as soon as I hit the pillow. What was strange was that I could feel myself fall asleep. For several moments, I could not move as my mind traveled from the realm of the conscious to the unconscious.

The weatherperson keeps saying that we should expect one to three more inches of snow. More snow? We have not had our first inch yet. We are only getting the occasional flurry right now.

Tagline for today: "The other night I came home late, and tried to unlock my house with my car keys. I started the house up. So, I drove it around for a while. I was speeding, and a cop pulled me over. He asked where I lived. I said, 'Right here, officer.'" - Steven Wright
