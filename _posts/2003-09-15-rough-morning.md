Ugh. I've got a single-cup coffee maker. I put it on a timer so it makes my coffee about a half hour before I get up. Usually, it works great. I had some problems with my system yesterday. Apparently, I had forgotten to put the coffee grounds in the night before. Unfortunately, I didn't realize it until after I put the cream and sugar in and gave it a taste. It wasn't the first thing I wanted to taste in the morning (or at any time for that matter).
