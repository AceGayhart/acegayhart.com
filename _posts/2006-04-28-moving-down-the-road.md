Now that Rachel and I got our bikes back from the shop, we are back to riding. The repair shop did a good job with our bikes. Rachel is able to shift again, and my brakes are much smoother now.

There is a three-mile trail connecting two parks that we have been using. At one end is a big hill. The first couple of times, we started at the top of the hill, went part way down the trail, and turned around. We could only make it partway up the hill before having to walk.

Wednesday, we started at the other end of the trail. The going was much easier this time. We did about five miles (plus some off road biking and hiking). It might be because the trail was flatter or because our muscles are starting to adjust. We probably could have gone a few more miles. Of course, we do not want to overdo it.
