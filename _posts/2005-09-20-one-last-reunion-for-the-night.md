After a brief rest at the hotel, Rachel and I headed to my mom Ellen and step dad Fred's house for dinner. My mom told my younger half-sister Megan that she should come over for dinner, but she did not say why. Megan was definitely surprised to see both Rachel and I.

We got a brief tour of the house. As expected, some things were the same and some were different. It was weird to see my niece Briana sleeping in what used to be my room.

We had some pizza for dinner and then every gathered around to view the pictures taken during our trip. Unfortunately, my laptop did not have a program that could do slide shows. Fortunately, as a software developer, I was able to write a quick program so we could view the pictures. Rachel and I stayed and talked with my family for a few hours before heading back to our hotel room (which still did not have internet access).

Tagline for today: "Son, a woman is a lot like a... a refrigerator! They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds. They make ice, and... um... Oh, wait a minute. Actually, a woman is more like a beer." - Homer Simpson
