Recently my employer instituted a policy that would let employees work four 10-hour days instead of five 8-hour days. At first, I was against it. My days seem long enough as it is; I certainly did not want them to get any longer. Then, after some time, I reconsidered. In a typical week, I work nine to ten hours a day anyway. So, I would actually end up working less time. In addition, as I drive nearly one hundred miles a day, I would definitely save on gas and vehicle wear. In addition, I would have an extra day a week to work on schoolwork, housework, etc.

I started my new time yesterday. So far, it is working out okay. Of course, it is a bit too early to tell.
