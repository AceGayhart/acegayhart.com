Boy am I stuffed! I just got back from Don Tequilas (a local Mexican restaurant). The last time Rachel and I went there, I dropped my business card into a box for a free lunch. I was not expecting to win. However, I was extremely surprised when I got a call saying that I won. Of course, going by myself would not be as much fun as going with nine other people. That is correct, I won lunch for ten people. Due to scheduling conflicts, only eight people showed up. It only cost us five minutes of our time to listen to a financial advisor. Most of us even enjoyed the advisor's time and might use his services.

So, it looks like a win all the way around. Actually, I will probably end up having to spend an extra hour on the treadmill. But, aside from wanting a nap now, it was well worth it. Besides, I need to write my next entry.

Tagline for today: "I went to this restaurant last night that was set-up like a big buffet in the shape of a ouija board. You'd think about what kind of food you want and the table would move across the floor to it." - Steven Wright
