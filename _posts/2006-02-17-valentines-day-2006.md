Happy (belated) Valentine's Day! Rachel and I did not do anything extremely exciting. However, we did go out to dinner with some family members. I got Rachel a necklace and some earrings. She got me a nice jacket. It is black with playing cards on the front and back. And, at eight dollars, the price was hard to beat.

Aside from that, the week has been routine. The weather here is about the same as always: unpredictable. Yesterday we had a high of 56 degrees. Tomorrow we are supposed to have a high of 18 degrees. I think that once the "high" temperatures get below freezing, they should no longer be considered "high".

Tagline for today: "A guy knows he's in love when he loses interest in his car for a couple of days." - Tim Allen
