I suppose that the title of my last blog post, "Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is," is rather appropriate. My last post was in March. I generally like to do at least one post a month. Anyway, here is my overdue entry:

Work has been going good. As I am currently working for R&D (Research and Development), I am not really allowed to go into any details (at least not publicly). I am finding myself working longer hours. This is not a complaint; just an observation. If I were not married, I would probably work from 8:00 AM until midnight. Of course, much as I would like to forget, I am getting older. I do not want to wear out my body too soon.:

An advantage to working late is that I do not have to face rush hour traffic. Well, at that is my theory. It is not working well. That is one of the reasons why Rachel and I decided to move. She commutes a half hour and I commute an hour in the same direction. We want to get a place about halfway between our two jobs. If Rachel can transfer to a different location, then hopefully we can work and live in the same city. Then, we will have a lot more free time.

Rachel has been diligently working to remove old wallpaper and patch holes. I did a bit of work, but quite frankly she does a much better job. We still have to pack some stuff up and do some painting. But, hopefully we will be able to put our house on the market soon. So, if you or anyone else needs a house....

As I was not busy enough, I recently started a class on statistics. From what I hear, it is one of the tougher classes. But, as long as I set enough time aside to study, I will do fine. Since I like to make things difficult, I am also trying to get a Microsoft certification. I have been spending lunch hours and any spare moments on test preparation.

Last week, I was able to afford several hours towards my certification. It seemed a bit weird to have so much free time. Well, it was not exactly free time; I was sitting at an airport. I flew down to Atlanta on business. So between flying and waiting to fly, I got a lot accomplished.

Of course, I got a lot accomplished while I was in Atlanta. Business matters aside, I was able to catch up with my sister Megan and her husband David. They live a few hours south of Atlanta. It had been a few years since we had seen each other, so it was nice to meet even for a short while.

On another topic, as many of you know, my wife Rachel is type-2 diabetic. Two years ago, her father passed away due to complications from diabetes. Last year, Rachel, and I participated in the American Diabetes Association's Tour de Cure bicycling fund-raising event. We raised $675.35 and rode ten miles. We have signed up to ride again this year for at least another ten miles.

For those who do not know, the Tour de Cure is a series of cycling events held in over 80 cities nationwide. The Tour is a ride, not a race; it features different route lengths from a leisurely 10-mile course to a demanding 100-mile journey. We have joined thousands of others to pedal in support of the Association's mission: to prevent and cure diabetes and to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes.

We are asking you to help by supporting my fund-raising efforts with a donation. Your tax-deductible gift will make a difference in the lives of more than 20 million Americans who suffer from diabetes and another 41 million people in the United States with pre-diabetes.

It is fast and easy to support this great cause - you can make your donation online via the links below.

Any amount, great or small, helps in the fight against this deadly disease. Someone donated about thirty cents last year. Rachel and I greatly appreciate your support and will keep you posted on my progress. If you want to do even more to help, please consider joining me in this great event. Our efforts will help set the pace in the fight against diabetes. In addition, we welcome anyone who wishes to ride with us.
