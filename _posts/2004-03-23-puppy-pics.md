As promised, here are a few pictures of our new babies. Kara and Kelly are tri-colored (brown, black and white) Beagles. Kara has a darker back and the white patch on her head goes to the right. Kelly has a lighter back and the white patch on her head goes to the left. Since they are so hard to tell apart, we decided to color-code them. Kara is the one sporting the pink harness. Kelly is wearing red. In this picture, you can see my wife giving them a hug.

Since Kara and Kelly aren't housebroken yet and because they're not used to the house yet, we decided to them a playpen. We put it up in the spare bedroom. They were a bit nervous at first, so I went inside with them. Now, they don't mind being in there. Well, that is until we leave the room. We were only out of the room for about ten minutes when they climbed out of the pen. Fortunately, I had some spare wire fencing material to create a roof for them.

Emily looking very jealousIn this picture, Kelly and Kara have taken over Emily's bed. Emily doesn't look too happy though. She'll get over it, I'm sure. Last night they were all running around together having fun. Well, at least they were trying to run around. Kara and Kelly have a habit of seeking out every nook and cranny. For example, they found a small gap in our fence that they were able to squeeze through. Also, they were able to crawl under the gate. So, until we're able to fix the problems, we either watch them a lot more closely or we put them on leads.

Kelly and Kara playing tug-of-warKara and Kelly chewing on a bone before bedtimeDuring playtime, Kara finds a Tigger to chew on. Later, Kelly and Kara play tug-of-war with each other. Since the two are sisters (or at least they grew up together), they tend to usually do the same things. It's actually kind of funny to watch them follow each other throughout the house. Finally, they are relaxing in their pen with a couple of nylon bones.

Before I forget, I want to put a plug in for Caleb's Canine Rescue. This is where we got Kara and Kelly. If you want a dog or if you just want to sponsor a dog, please check them out.

Tagline for today: "I put contact lenses in my dog's eyes. They had little pictures of cats on them. Then I took one out and he ran around in circles." - Steven Wright
