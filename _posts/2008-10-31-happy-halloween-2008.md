I know that today is Halloween, but it does not feel like it. It is probably because Rachel and I did not buy any candy this year to hand out (or for us). With me being unemployed, that tends to put a damper on any festivities. I did see a few trick-or-treaters a few hours ago at six. That was all that came by. So, maybe it is a good thing we did not spend money on candy. Anyway, I hope your holiday was better than ours was.
