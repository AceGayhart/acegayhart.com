This has been a rather long weekend. Rachel got a notice from the Ohio BMV (Bureau of Motor Vehicles) on Friday saying that her driver's license is suspended. After some investigation, I found the problem: Apparently, she was supposed to submit medical papers to the BMV every six months stating that it is okay for her to drive (because of her diabetes). Anyway, either we did not get the forms from the BMV or we misplaced them. Therefore, I have been her chauffer for the last couple of days and I will probably continue to do so for at least another week.

My first week of school is finally over. I completed the first five weeks of homework. I wanted to finish the entire class this week, but driving Rachel around disrupted my time schedule. I was able to take my Math and English placement tests though. I was expecting to do poorly on English (as it's not one of my strong subjects). I got a three (out of six). The score was higher than I had expected, but not high enough to get me out of the entry-level class. I did better on my Math test; I got 79%. This was high enough to allow me to skip the entry-level class.

Tagline for today: "I got my driver's license photo taken out of focus on purpose. Now when I get pulled over the cop looks at it [moving it nearer and farther, trying to see it clearly], and says 'Here, you can go.'" - Steven Wright
