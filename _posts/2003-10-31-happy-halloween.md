Well, my wife and I spent two hours handing out candy. It had been a few years since we've handed out candy before. It was nice handing out candy again. In the city of Lorain, candy is only handed out between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM. This makes it a lot easier to plan for. I think we ended up giving out more than 10 pounds of candy!
