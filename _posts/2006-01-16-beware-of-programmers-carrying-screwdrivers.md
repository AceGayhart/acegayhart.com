Last weekend was very quiet especially compared to the prior weekend. Rachel and I slept in late on Saturday. Around 10:00 PM, we finally got out of the house to do some much-needed grocery shopping. As I was browsing the aisles, I decided to buy my first screwdriver. No, I did not buy the mechanical kind. I bought the liquid kind (orange juice and vodka). Rachel and I split the drink that night. It tasted okay. I think next time, however, I will buy the orange juice and vodka separately. It will probably be less expensive. Aside from a slight aftertaste, neither of us suffered any ill effects. Of course, we slept in for quite some time. We decided we might buy some more; it will help us sleep better.

I have heard the phrase "beware of programmers carrying screwdrivers" before. Now it will take on a completely new meaning.
