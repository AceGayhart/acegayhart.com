I've been using a great program lately called POPFile. It's a free program I found on SourceForge.Net. Basically, it's a POP3 proxy server that sorts e-mail into buckets. You go through and tell POPFile the buckets that e-mail should belong to (spam, work, personal, etc). After it analyzes the first bit of e-mails, it starts to sort out the e-mail automatically. You just have to tell it if the sorting was correct or not. The more e-mails it processes, the more accurate it becomes. Also, you can have it modify the subject and/or the message header based on the bucket. This allows me to have my rules in Outlook automatically handle my spam. It also saves me from having to download me twice (once with a third-party spam filter and again with Outlook). It probably saves me a half an hour to an hour a day!

Tagline for today: "Have you ever noticed that they put advertisements in with your bills now? Like bills aren't distasteful enough, they have to stuff junk mail in there with them. I get back at them. I put garbage in with my check when I mail it in. Coffee grinds, banana peels... I write, 'Could you throw this away for me? Thank You.'" - Andy Rooney
