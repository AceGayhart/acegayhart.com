Well, I thought I was done writing for the night, but I have another entry. Our upstairs toilet overflowed. I was able to shut the water off to the toilet, but not before water started to run through the floor to the downstairs. I had to poke a small hole in our downstairs bathroom ceiling so that the water had a place to go. Looks like I've got another chore to do tomorrow.
