The taxi ride from the hotel to the train station was interesting. The station was only two or three blocks away. But, with all of the traffic and with half the streets being closed, it took us at least twenty minutes to make the trip.

When we arrived at the station, the attendant notified us that the train was running about an hour late. Since we had some extra time, we decided to repack our belongings and to distribute our stuffed animals and other souvenirs.

After we completed rearranging, the couple that we had met on the westbound train entered the station. Rachel and I talked for a bit and showed them all of our souvenirs. Then, Rachel and I played Crazy Eights until my step mom Norma and dad Jimmy showed up. We sat and talked for at least an hour. Just after five o'clock, the train arrived. So, we got up, said our goodbyes, and boarded the train.

Today's travels on the train were relatively uneventful. Rachel and I had dinner around seven, and are about to start watching a movie.
