Today's journey on the train was uneventful (read relaxing). Rachel and I got up around 6:30 and headed down to breakfast. I do not remember what she ate, but I had a light breakfast. All of this rich food was starting to catch up with me.

We went back to our room and played Uno for a while before falling asleep out of boredom. A few hours of sleep later, we arrived at Grand Junction, Colorado. The stop was very brief, but Rachel and I had enough time to hop off the train and buy some souvenirs (along with just about everyone else who was onboard).

Shortly after the stop at Grand Junction, we made our way back to the dining car for lunch. After a long lunch, we went back to the room for more card playing and movie watching.

Around 6:30 PM, we stopped at the entrance to the Moffat Tunnel. We had to sit there for some time until a westbound train had cleared the tunnel. Then, we had to wait for the tunnel to vent. At 7:00 PM, we were still waiting. Since it was time for our dinner reservations, and since you are not supposed to go between cars while in the tunnel, Rachel and I went to the dining car. We were told that they would serve dinner after we had gone through the tunnel. Ugh. There was nothing to do except to back to our room and wait.

Finally, we started moving through the six-mile tunnel. About twenty minutes later, we were back in the dining card and eating dinner.

Tagline for today: "When I was five years old I was on a merry go round. There was a gunshot nearby. The horses stampeded. There I was running down the street on a purple wooden horse." - Steven Wright
