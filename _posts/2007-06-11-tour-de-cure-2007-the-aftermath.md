Yesterday, Rachel and I rode in the American Diabetes Association's Tour de Cure 2007. We signed up to do the 10K ride. We had a good time, but we should have done more preparation. Last year, 10K was a breeze. Of course, that was because we had been doing a lot of riding. This year, we had only one or two rides before the event. Consequently, I had to struggle to make it through. But, aside from a slight sunburn, we both turned out okay.

We do the ride to support the ADA, for fun, and for the exercise. But, the gifts are nice too. We received a t-shirt and lunch like last year. This year, we also received a few baseball caps, another t-shirt, and a few other miscellaneous items. In all, we had a good time and we are already signed up for next year.
